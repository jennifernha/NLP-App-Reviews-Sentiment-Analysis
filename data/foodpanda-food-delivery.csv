5,Yogiyuls,2019-08-02 06:19:31,Convenience at its best!!,False,"We’re staying at a hotel in Phuket for a month long vacation. But hotel prices for food are drastically higher than any of the restaurants. Kids don’t want to leave poolside and we were forced to overpay for meals - ordering from hotel, Food Panda really helped out!! Once we discovered this Service - I couldn’t believe that it’s possible!! Not only there is no delivery charges, there is almost always coupon available to use (on top of already lower prices of meals!). Delivery is quick and food always arrives hot, on time and in great condition!! Drivers are very polite and nice and although happy to receive tip - never expect it as a must! Now my kids can play at the pool all day, we get great food delivered straight to us and we do not pay insane prices of the hotel restaurants!! Thank you Food Panda! We will definitely continue to use this service when we go back home!",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
1,Gio770414,2021-09-25 13:46:25,The most embarrassing customer experience,False,"Dear FoodPanda, Thank you for copying and pasting over and over prewritten emails without even reading what your customers say. With extreme disappointment I have to say that I have been served with the poorest and the most embarrassing customer service ever possible. As a senior executive of a company that makes of customer experience their priority, you are proving to know nothing about your customers and so your business. The order was cancelled because of your mistakes and 2 days later you are still copying an pasting the same emails without even reading my messages or understanding what happened. This is simply unacceptable and unfortunately I don’t have any more time to waste with you. I am going to block this payment and do whatever I can to get my 200HKD back, not because of the small amount, but because it’s a matter of principle. I can promise you that you have lost me as a customer forever. Your business won’t suffer for it, don’t worry, but the way in which you serve your customers have been proven to be embarrassing and ridiculously wrong. Since you don’t read the feedback or requests from your customers you won’t probably understand or learn anything from here. What a shame… Congratulations FoodPanda, I can certainly say that you have given to me the worst customer experience in my 44 years! Good luck, G",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
1,Bashar Bhuiyan,2021-07-07 02:55:10,They don’t want to refund you fully in Bangladesh,False,"Once , Some items were missing from one of my order. When I asked the delivery person, he said , he will bring it tomorrow. (Funny proposal, isn’t it? ) So I asked for a refund, The agent wanted to refund me less than half the amount of what i lost and said , its the best he could do. I kept asking him again and again , how much did I lose? (As i could not check at that moment , i did not know how while i was chating with an agent )No matter what , he would not answer me. But later i was able to check and kept asking him , why will i be refunded less than half ? How was that fair? He kept saying its the best he could do and wanted to leave again and again( he did not though) . But I kept telling him that it was unfair . Maybe after 15 to 20 minutes (could be more) he refunded me the full amount. 

I went through a harassment with that. I wish i could hold that agent accountable for what he did. But foodpanda has no Customer Care Number in Bangladesh . I guess , not refunding the customer fully and also claiming the remaining money from the restaurant later is a new way of making some more money for food panda Bangladesh.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
1,RazBng,2020-03-21 07:57:23,It’s really bad,False,"First of all, the app is saying that certain restaurants do not deliver to my address but when I change the street number to two blocks away suddenly the restaurants become available. Second issue is, after adding the items to the cart and want to checkout, the app is saying that the items are no longer available (my guess is they are to busy at that time and can’t deliver, but I don’t understand why they wouldn’t just say that). After 20-30 minutes, when I try again, I’m able to checkout and place the order (they might have some free spots available). After all of this hustle, I’m just happy that I’ve managed to place the order but to my surprise, sometimes, the order gets canceled when it’s close to arrival time. After talking to other users, it seems that they’ve stumbled upon these issues as well. I can get over the fact that they don’t have a group order, or that I need to walk two blocks from my address to pick up the order, or that I need to try multiple times to place the actual order, but the overall app experience and their delivery system is just bad.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
2,jamie-899,2019-07-01 12:08:44,Customer Service Leaves a lot to be Desired,False,"If food is running late then all they say is sorry. The message that tells me this comes through to me via text about 50 times. Another issue is restaurants accepting your order, you wait, then 10 minutes before the food is meant to arrive Food Panda texts to say “[restaurant] just closed, sorry about that”. You’ve then wasted your time, and no repercussions on the restaurant as far as I know. Also, they dish out coupons like crazy but only for new customers. I was asked by their employees to rate their app 5 stars on this store in exchange for vouchers whilst visiting the Expo at Impact Arena here in Bangkok. Got my vouchers and now I find out they’re only for new customers too - the employees saw the app on my phone and I told them I’ve used the service multiple times. Talk about tricksters! Customer service didn’t want to help me when I told them neither. I’ve changed my rating and will start looking into Grab Food and similar apps available here. Good concept but poor customer service and loyalty to those already signed up.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
1,so disappointed client,2020-04-12 10:05:23,Worst CS ever,False,"Because of the quarantine I use Foodpanda several times. And I must thank those riders. Though sometimes the package got leaked or my soup ruined. I never complain. It s the time. But I got really mad this time. I ordered my food Foodpanda estimated its arrival about 45min later. Then I got called in an important meeting. My rider came early about just 20mins. I couldn’t leave. I asked him could he wait or if he could come back 20minutes later I will tip him nicely. Then the rider started blackmailing me and asked for the equal amount of money as my food. Right at that moment the dispatcher called to cancel my order. I asked the dispatcher was there any solution he offered nothing but to cancel my order which I have already paid. I lost my food the day and my money. Not to mention I was cut off by the dispatcher whose English I tried so hard to understand with patience and kindness. And when I contacted their Customer service, three times! And they never give you any solution. And blame it on you! Your blackmailing rider your useless unqualified dispatcher! And the trouble I have to starve for!

5,XTheIdealistX,2021-07-20 05:37:42,Amazing! Full of Variety and Options!,False,"So the app is easy to use, highly ascetic - who can refuse a cute panda? And most importantly- it’s more than a small array of restaurants. From food to essentials, with stores that have actually given you a great array of options from their stock vs typical basics that won’t always satisfy your needs. It may not have play by play tracking but having approximate times with more options to serve you better makes it far superior to its competitors. Icing on this fantastic cake (I may just order one after this) is that the app does incentivize consistently- you don’t need to spend over a hundred dollars constantly to get a paltry benefit like 5 dollars off. No general amounts and purchases can easily reap you discounts more routinely and simply add to the convenience of it all. So in all- 10/10 I certainly recommend.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,

2,Wojo74327,2021-02-17 06:52:51,"Good order functionality, terrible customer service.",False,"When things go well, there is no problem.  However, inevitably, you will receive an order with a missing / wrong item. It seems FoodPanda does everything in their power to avoid having to offer a refund - from discretely responding to inquiries via email (instead of through the app where the original message was sent), to requiring you to make a choice on type of refund, and finally, once I provided my choice of refund, it was never sent. It seems these processes are built to make it more difficult for consumers to get a refund.  It’s been over 2 weeks since my order and I still haven’t received a refund. 

Can’t complain about how well the food ordering function of the app works - because it works well.  But after my experience with their customer service, it feels they intentionally give customers the run-around with the intention of making it as difficult as possible to get a refund.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
3,Arooba Mansoor,2020-06-21 00:34:42,Customer Service needs to improve,False,The foodpanda app has no contact options which is extremely problematic since I’ve had trouble with multiple orders. When I tried cancelling my order it would give me the option to cancel my order and then say that it couldn’t be cancelled because the restaurant had accepted my request. It gives no option to contact the restaurant directly or foodpanda representatives in case of any trouble. What kind of service is this? Once you order you’re trapped? The chat option has also been removed. When you open the website on a browser it magically has some sort of contact number hidden somewhere but on the app it’s nowhere to be found. Even tracking the order is extremely inconvenient because when we ask where is my order their response is we don’t know. What is even the point of having a help centre in the first place? Please fix this issue.,foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
5,BLAQHAWK,2021-07-05 10:28:19,Horrible App Update!!!!!,False,"July 5, 2021 - The current update is working well and I have had no issues with it. I’m glad they brought back the ability to see where the delivery driver is located, so I can be downstairs waiting when arrive. It’s not real-time tracking like it was a couple years ago, but it updates pretty frequently. 

19 Apr 2020 - the current app update is HORRIBLE, do not update! They removed the ability to see where the rider is and they removed the ability to move the map around. You cannot even scroll around to see where the exact location of the restaurant is anymore, HORRIBLE!!!!

I always wait for the drivers 10 minutes before their eta because I had already heard stories about them leaving after only a couple of minutes so I decided not to risk it. However, today the driver picked up my food and on the app it appeared he did not even come close to my place. I waited in the yard where all drivers know where to hand the food. I saw drivers pulling over and handing the food but mine never came. He had the audacity to cancel and now I can't be refunded because he ""tried"" to reach me.

5,dat_danny_doe,2020-11-21 06:06:38,Amazing Service!!!,False,"Okay, so before I begin let me start off by saying I found this app by searching for a way to order food from outside of the country of origin.

I’m an Amerikano with a Filipina SO and I wanted to try and order her food. Came upon a good opportunity to cheer her up with a milkshake and took it. Had never used the app before and actually ended up putting in the address wrong. Capital One worked internationally much to my excitement, and I messaged the rider about correcting the address and they used my correction and got it there very quickly. From the other side of the world, I was able to experience the joy of getting my girl a milkshake to cheer her up. Thank you so much Foodpanda, thank you thank you thank you!

Will definitely be using this app again!",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
4,iMacPro,2019-03-13 05:25:30,Should improve the apps further,False,"I read reviews that foodpanda is always late. Normally they r late because the restaurant side delayed the food preparation. I have tried to order from stores stating 30mins but 30mins become 45mins, 1 hour in few times. The 1 hr wait from 25mins at off peak liked 11am was the last straw. I never ordered from that restaurant anymore. 

However I feel that the apps only show the real updated time of the whole delivery. On the real time tracking, they should also put the time order was placed. So we know the time has been changed (few times) to show the change in delivery timing. When I’m a new user, I keep on wondering why is it forever 30-35mins. But time had actually passed by. 

Once I have also placed an order for something near, the driver took a big detour to elsewhere. Although stated as reach but he personally called me to inform that he will be late. I’m ok with this. Sometimes if on the way and only 5-10mins extra I can wait. Plus there’s communication from driver. At least I won’t be left hanging did he went wrong route? 

Overall I only use foodpanda n their services r still not bad. Just that I don’t know how to read reviews left by myself n others. Not v user friendly apps.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,

Of course, this becomes exhausting and today, I slipped and sprained my ankle getting off the ferry. Decided to give this app a try and it failed. While I do not blame the driver, the restaurant or even the customer service agent, this app is faulty. It auto populates your location. And so for some reason the address was way off when it did so even though the map location looked correct. The driver calls me, asking where I am and I can only respond in English though I tried the words for Hotel etc. and I said the hotel name and everything. So I contacted customer service and they asked me to meet the driver at that random location that I have no idea how to find. 

At that point, I said keep the food and the money. I didn’t even ask for a refund. The app is broken.

Just to find out my driver took 2 hours just to get to the restaurant and the restaurant closed on them. I dont understand when there estimated time of arrival to me was 10p but they barely got to the restaurant at 10:15 and surprised that the restaurant was closed. So with it being past the time of estimated arrival to me, all other restaurants were then also closed. So left with no other choice but to starve over night in hopes just to find food in the morning. I WOULD NEVER use this app again!!! I might as well just called the restaurant itself to have placed my order and paid more for delivery fee then to be left starving over night. I would not recommend this app unless you want the chances of being left starving at night. BTW I was being very nice that I placed my order at 8p to give them plenty of time to get my order to me.

I immediately messaged them (since there is no longer a telephone hotline) and got no response. Then I saw my messages had been deleted. I tried again and finally got a message saying it was ok and the rider would be redirected to the correct address. Then one hour after my order had been created I got a phone call saying that they would not deliver as it was out of the delivery zone, and said it was all my fault because I had input the wrong address. Their app is actually at fault because it went to the incorrect address to begin with. Furthermore, although they refuse to deliver they have still charged my credit card and won’t refund for a few days.

Their customer service rep refused the idea that their system had any problems and said I should have chosen the district correctly to begin with. Problem is their app doesn’t allow you to do that!

How can they charge me money for something they refuse to deliver? And to have us wait an hour before informing us the order wouldn’t be sent?

Prepaid my food via credit card. Apps says the driver has arrived but is no where to be seen.

What kind of food service makes people pay first, make them wait over 50 minutes just to be told the driver is not reachable and will refund my order. No apologies were given. Did the driver pick up my order and got an accident/ ate my order? Plus the app did not let me order via cash payment just because there were 2 cancelled orders when the driver clearly couldn’t find my place and I was unable to pick up a phone call while working.

But the food almost always arrives pretty quickly. If there is a problem with your order, a very nice lady from Food Panda calls and explains what’s wrong — “the soup is not available ka!” — and offers a solution.

Yup! 2 hours! But the worst part is, that they waited 2 HOURS TO CANCEL MY ORDER. I waited 2 hours, only for my food to get cancelled. COME ON, WHAT?!?! And not to mention the User Interface.

4,Khun Manao,2018-03-15 04:26:02,This App needs works. I like the Delivery Service,False,"This App is annoying. 
2 Major flaw’s that have not been addressed.

1- Random address the app selects each time I open the App. I have a profile with a delivery address, this address has been delivered to 25+ times, But each time I open the app it selects a random nearby address(?).
- Why have a profile if it’s not used? If you don’t pay attention the food will be sent to a wrong address.

The Pizza, KFC’s app’s don’t behave this way.

2- Previous order.
I tend to order the same things. I can see my previous orders but cannot select them for reordering. This feature is available in other food delivery Apps, either as a reorder or being able to save favorites that can be reordered.
Having to reenter the order consumes extra time reduces the ease of use and creates a poorer user experience.

These are two simple flaws that are a major annoyance and are easily fixed.
Fix these two flaws your user experience will be greatly enhanced.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,

Tips: • Do not order if you are starving or feeling impatient. The preparation time is unpredictable and sometimes delays will be unavoidable especially during peak hours.
         • Don't rely on their chat services. It's pretty much useless.
         • Preparation time usually depends on the restaurant your ordering from. If you ordered from a restaurant with high demand, you'll probably wait a long time 'til your order is prepared.
         • Only order if you have time to spare and if you can still manage your hunger.

I am much more willing to hand an iPad to my guests so they can select items than I am my personal phone.   Only an iPhone version is available and it is poor on iPad.  I often skip foodpanda because of this.

I have yet to find a pizza offering that allows me to select the ingredients I want a la carte.  Do you not make it convenient for restaurants to add a set of checkboxes for this?

This makes it possible to accidentally send food to the wrong place if you’re used to always sending food to your default location (e.g., your home) and then once decide to order food while you’re at another location.

I tried contacting customer service when I realized what had happened but had to try multiple times and wait a long time for a response. Eventually I got routed to a service center in another country and got a long distance phone call from someone I could barely hear. I would have gladly paid an extra delivery fee to change the address, but he told me they can’t change the address and won’t refund my money, so I ended up paying for a bunch of food that I didn’t receive.

I don’t want to sound so negative, the service dose the job on delivering food but the wrong food and bad service! So if you’re hungry this app will get you food ASAP but don’t expect to get what you ordered nor to get it to your doorstep.

2) Foodpanda G.P.S. / Status not working correctly 

3) When you need to cancel / update an order, the “bot” service tries to stall you until the restaurant begins preparing and too late to cancel. 

4) Chat is Bot technology, still in its infancy 

5) When there is a delay, they blame it on the restaurant, several times I had a driver who made multiple stops before my house (probably picking up and dropping off other orders.

The app will not let me pay with credit card, or add a new credit card, and only lets us pay with cash half of the time. Meaning half the time, the app just doesn’t accept payment. Which means I can’t use the app.

I finally deleted the app after one of the drivers delivered an order to an address that I didn’t live at and called from his mobile demanding that I let him into the building without saying who he was or where he was from. Then he just left the food there. I told him it was the wrong address, but he just hung up on me. I spoke with customer service, and the guy suggested i go to the other address and pick it up myself. The other address was even further away from my house than the original restaurant and I had no access to it. So, not only did they not deliver the food to me, which is really what their service is supposed to be in the first place, they also refused to rectify the situation. They refused to deliver the food to me and refused reimburse me for it. They moved the food even further away from me than it originally was at the restaurant and then had the nerve to tell me to go and pick it up myself. Not only that, but the restaurant was then closed, so I couldn’t reorder the food. I have had countless issues with Food Panda getting my orders wrong also, or taking my money for an order and then saying the restaurant ran out of supplies and couldn’t make my food and they would reimburse me for it but didn’t. They have wasted countless hours of my time and a lot of my money.

1,Konbit,2020-06-10 07:18:42,Terrible customer service and experience,True,"Refused to delete my account after multiple requests. 

Repeatedly changed their customer service protocols to provide less transparency and accountability. Including: discontinuing phone support; discontinuing chat support; discontinuing driver geolocation throughout the process; denying access to customer-service managers; replacing all customer service representatives with the most basic and useless FAQ that I’ve ever seen.

Customer-service representatives – when they existed – could take longer than Foodpanda’s notoriously slow deliveries to answer a single basic question.

Customer service representatives  – when they existed – repeatedly lied about why deliveries that were late, blaming restaurants for Foodpanda’s own logistics failures, thus defaming  the restaurant brands.

The Foodpanda app blatantly lies about the expected delivery time during the ordering process in order to secure sales. Then is chronically late. (A bait and switch.) 

Deliveries are substantially later – in terms of both duration and frequency – than any of its competitors. (Or its algorithms are so broken, that they shouldn’t be in the tech industry to begin with.)

Rates being charged to restaurants (by the entire delivery industry) are obscene and unethical, especially  during a crisis wherein restaurants are struggling to survive

Three deliveries are put on a single bike ensuring the last two are indelibly cold when delivered an hour later

Since Foodpanda refuses to offer anything close to customer service, they leave their poor, underpaid drivers as the frontline of defense against [rightfully] irate customers.

The insultingly piddly 30 baht vouchers that you think make up for thousands of baht of late, ruined food – caused by Foodpanda’s negligence – are insulting. 

This app's high rating is surely gamed, as I know nobody in Bangkok who doesn't hate this service (with a bit of a monopoly). Thankfully, Line Man, Grab and some others are beginning to offer alternatives...",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,"{'id': 11340301, 'body': 'Hey Konbit, \r\n\r\nThanks for reaching out. \r\n\r\nWe aim to provide all our customers with the best service possible.

Confused we contacted Food Panda who told us the pizzas were on the way?!? The pizzas arrived in pizza boxes with no logo and they tasted awful. Upon looking closely at the restaurant reviews in Food Panda we found that the pizzas came from a completely different restaurant with the same name. There were some bad reviews claiming the same bait and switch. Oddly enough, the ""good reviews"" came from the same people (with the same wording) more than once. Hmmm... I did try posting a review of our negative experience, but I don't think they were happy about me mentioning my annoyance at Food Panda for not clarifying that the restaurant they advertised wasn't linked with the REAL one.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,

However, trying to reset your password sends you to your email (you can't reset it in the app), which sends you to the webpage, where you get a password reset dialogue. No problem! Yet. Then, after you've seen the password dialogue for a moment, it disappears under an ad for the app. You know, those annoying ""try our app"" wallpapers that appear when you access a website on your phone? Thanks, but there is a REASON I am trying to access the website on my phone. You can click ""go to website"" but that takes you to the homepage, and you can't get back to the password dialogue. So, since you can't reset your password on your phone, you have to open your computer, go to email, click the link, then finally reset you password, then get your phone again, re-enter your new password and only THEN are you logged in. Of course, that means that you can only do it when you have a computer around, which kind of kills the point of mobile technology, and mobile technology is what the app is for! It also stinks when you have 20 people standing around asking why food panda isn't working and why the pizza will be late...",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,

And yes, i did call the hotline, at 10pm, and they made me hold for around 10mins just to tell me that they would call me again because they had to reach the rider that was delivering my order. And NO! They didn't call again! And then i just gave up waiting for it. It arrived at 11pm, the food was very cold! Very bad service from foodpanda. and it is not the first time that i ordered through this app and even from that restaurant through this app. Previous times the food arrived at least an hour  late tops or it was on time.

Delivery times are almost always off - often by as much as 3 hours.  Food panda will consistently be wrong about menu items.  They both leave off much of restaurants menus but they will also list many items that are not available.  Further more they will list many restaurants as closed that are open.  If you leave notifications on in the app you will constantly get notifications suggesting items from nearby restaurants for lunch or dinner - but they have never been food.  They always suggest items from the drinks menu: water, sprite, etc… Their customer service is usually fairly prompt to answer the phone with a person but they are rarely competent or helpful.

1) Foodpanda asked me to check with Dominos
2) Dominos asked me to contact Foodpanda
3) Same thing repeats

I ended up explaining entire issue from bottom up multiple times to new customer care agents as the chat times out and there are no alerts on the phone screen when the agent replies back to you. If you don't respond under 2 mins it goes inactive. You have to do this all over again. 

There was no ticket number to refer back to. There is no process. 

5) No agent from Foodpanda is prepared to take up ownership. When they finally agreed to take ownership, they promised to call me in 2 days. The call never came. I contacted them again. They asked me to wait for 5 mins. Then, chat went dead saying I've not been active. Now I have to explain the entire thing to another agent. Kuldeep didn't call me back. The guy before him promised me he would call back. His name was Sadanand or something. 

Pathetic service. I don't recommend this app to anyone, especially ordering pizza with dominos. Directly contact Dominos.

For example, salad concept's menus are missing a few salad toppings that we order all of the time in the store, which is frustrating.

After waiting 2 hours for my food, the best they can do for me is apparently canceling my order. They even had the nerve to charge their service fee after causing this inconvenience.

Weaknesses for me include no optional toppings changes (ie. no onion) to pizza orders and locality problems - my regular restaurant doesn't show in my results list even though it's just 2km away; it only shows in my reorder list. The reorder feature is great, but because my optional toppings has to go into the comments/notes for my order, each week I have to manually add those comments and get a phone call to confirm the price changes. I'd prefer if reorder worked, optional toppings was available, and therefore price was automatic and phone call didn't need to happen.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,

Also if they can add the ability to order from multiple restaurants at the same time would be great, I wouldn't mind paying additional service fees.

2,Oogybgy,2017-02-25 05:12:53,Just mediocre- much room for improvement,False,This app is very rudimentary and isn't anywhere near what food service apps are in the United States. It takes 5 clicks to accomplish what could be done in one. It's not obvious the first time you use it how certain functions work. The actual food panda service is very inconsistent and meals often arrive like warm instead of hot. They need better insulation in their delivery bags. Glad to see the payment in the mobile app has been fixed- it was broken for over 2 months and you could only order from a PC which is absurd.

After Gourmet Union Burger got my order wrong (they sent chili fries instead of chili), I called to get the right item redelivered--when Foodpanda talked to the restaurant, they said the chili always comes with fries, which is total bs. I've ordered from them a dozen times before and it's always been just chili, not French fries with a dollop of chili. If they changed the menu, then they should revise the description to chili fries, not chili. My issue though is not with the restaurant, it's with the fact that FoodPanda sided with the restaurant, even though my order history clearly shows that I've ordered the same thing from them dozens of times before (why would I all of a sudden say the order is wrong if it wasn't?), and at first refused to give me a refund OR redelivery. Seriously what kind of customer service is that? Oh you got the wrong order? Sorry, we're just going to take your money and leave you hungry, AND waste your time repeating to you what the problem is as if I didn't already know. I asked to speak to their manager, who apparently wasn't there, which explains why it sounds like a monkey circus in their call center, so they said they'd return my call later. Three hours later, nothing, so I called them back, and after arguing for half an hour, they finally said they'd refund the money for the chili. Is it really supposed to be this difficult? I'm switching to Deliveroo or whatever other service there is, because FoodPanda does not give a toss about their customers, and will do everything they can to not refund you your money if the order is wrong. Their delivery men are also ALWAYS SUPER CREEPY.

4,Benjamin Xap,2019-04-18 06:51:00,"Much improved, getting close to perfection",False,"One year I wrote a scathingly negative review of FoodPanda. Recently I started to use it again and am impressed with how much it has improved. Payment methods and order tracking has improved and works smoothly. Their delivery back end and overall management obviously works better now because orders almost always come on time. I’m giving them 4 stars, but I want to give them 4 and a half. Most people will probably give them 5, but there are some things I think she should add or improve:
[1] Address adding and deleting and selecting is still not working quite right. Weird stuff happens when I create an address from browser then try to use it in the app. You need to do some more detailed test cases. I’m not going to give you the test cases for you. Let me just say that there are definitely bugs.

1,mmrrkk,2019-03-21 09:52:06,"Decent service, poorly designed app.",False,"Foodpanda is the only game in town when it comes to grubhub-style food delivery in chiang mai. So I use it frequently, but it has a number of design flaws which seem to be obvious things to fix in testing. 

the awful paypal integration is a good illustration of the developers' negligence. first off, you need to select your preferred form of payment for each transaction. then you need to authenticate inside a web form (not one that can access saved system passwords) each time. from there (since i use a complex secure password managed by my OS) i have to go into settings to copy it and paste it in. however when i highlight the password entry field, it attempts to auto fill my *foodpanda* password. so i need to tap the field, hit a key to activate the incorrect auto fill, then delete the whole thing and paste in the correct password. THEN upon submitting the form, the app asks if i want to update my *foodpanda* password with the paypal password i just entered, so then i hit No. only after that is payment set up. however if they integrated paypal correctly, you could literally authenticate once (using password auto fill correctly) and never enter your paypal info into the app again. 

this is basic stuff that's already been done correctly by thousands of other developers. foodpanda makes plenty of revenue so i really see no excuse other than developer negligence.

other problems with the app include:
- wildly inaccurate delivery estimation times
- no way to contact the driver (or get info about the driver) through the app
- inability to use out-of-country phone numbers in the contact info
- a map display that frequently breaks (stops displaying order status info) and requires reset of the app
- automatically adds food to your cart with a single tap but makes it require many taps to remove food from your cart, resulting in lots of accidental additions which then need to be corrected.
- some menu items have a detail view open by default when you tap them; for others a tap simply adds it to the cart and the detail view can only be accessed from the checkout screen.
- when reordering a previous order, special notes to the restaurant (e.g. ""no mayo"") are either omitted or invisible to the user
- many restaurants simply disregard special notes / requests completely. it's a guessing game whether order notes will have any effect.
- feedback systems (for restaurants and individual orders) are very difficult to find and even harder to figure out how to use. as a result there are almost no reviews posted for most restaurants, assuming you even know where to look for them.
- the app displays frequent intrusive advertisements which are displayed *every time* the app regains screen focus, regardless of whether the user is able to take advantage of the promotion (for example, i might see a full screen ad giving me a new customer discount code which i can't use, every single time i navigate back to the app from somewhere else on my phone). very similar to how Grab does it.

and these are just the things i can think of off the top of my head as i write this in a hurry. please foodpanda, you could be a good app. these are basic design problems you're ignoring, and they've really piled up. thanks for reading.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,"{'id': 11328569, 'body': '""Hey there, Thanks for reaching out.

It would be nice to search restaurants by radial proximity, but as it is, I need to do 2-4 separate searches to find all the food options around me.",foodpanda-food-delivery,758103884,
