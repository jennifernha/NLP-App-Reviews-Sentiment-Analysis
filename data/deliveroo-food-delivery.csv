5/26/21 7:01,biocjenkins,No drop off and leave option,"We are in the middle of a pandemic, and yet I do not see an option on Deliveroo anywhere that says my delivery person can drop the food off at my front door and just leave. A true contactless delivery. Every time I have had to tell the riders to just leave the food and feel free to go when they call me, but the delivery riders don't always speak the best English. The last straw was today when a delivery rider that didn't understand English very well didn't attempt my delivery once I called him and the app will not refund me the $17. Switching to UberEats permanently, because even though they're more expensive, they have a drop off only option. Spending a few dollars extra on a delivery fee when I order delivery is much better than spending $1 on delivery but then whole $20 orders get wasted sometimes due to a feature that frankly should have been implemented more than a year ago at the start of the pandemic.",5,FALSE,deliveroo-food-delivery,1001501844,
1/9/21 19:56,MakiaMullen,Worst customer support and service,"Delieveroo during the pandemic has been a fantastic resource for getting delicious food whilst stuck at home. However their customer support is absolutely HORRENDOUS. 

The handful of times an order says it’s been delivered and the driver tracker showed they obviously went somewhere else and just drove off, the driver spilled or crushed our meals. There strategy of their customer “support” seems to be to CONSISTENTLY blame the customer and actively refuse to give us refunds effectively stealing funds for undelivered services.

The last straw for me today was having a deliverer ring us on the phone and aggressively DEMAND that we walk 5 minutes one way to meet him. we gave him detailed directions even listed then in our delivery notes but when we politely refused to walk that far and offered directions again, he hung up, then lied and said the delivery was made (we were literally standing outside in the cold for 3 minutes waiting for him as the text said he was “near by”. We immediately contacted a customer service rep who refused to issue a refund because the “order was delivered” and suggested we “change the address” even though we’ve not had issues with folks finding the address before. Ridiculous and thieving. We’ve decided we’re going to place orders directly with restaurants now. Screw you deliveroo.",1,FALSE,deliveroo-food-delivery,1001501844,

This happened few times so I’ll share one example - my food was running an hour late vs the app estimate. Deliveroo just kept moving the estimated delivery by 5mins. So I kept waiting. 1) The customer representative told me that they reached out to the restaurant and it will be with me shortly. 2) half hour later I got the same response from a different customer service representative, which makes me think it’s not a real human but some computer response. 3) called the restaurant and turns out it wasn’t open at all, so somehow Deliveroo let me order from a place that was closed. 4) I related this fact to the next customer service representative (now 2 hours after my original delivery) and she said that they can’t refund me but they will investigate. After 30 to 45 minutes more of reasoning that the opening hours indicate it’s closed and nobody answers their phone, they eventually refunded me.

2. I’m unable to text or message the driver, I can only make a phone call. The whole point of using an app is to not call people (and consume minutes). Why can’t we message via the app? 

3. Even with the address entered, and also additional notes on how to find my flat in central London, the driver still couldn’t find it. Thus ending up with more phone calls.  

4. The driver entered into the app that they “have arrived” and also called me to say they’re waiting for me downstairs. But of course they’re not there. I went down anyway just in case, and no, they were in some other location. 

5. Before claiming to have arrived, Drivers should buzz/ring the flat. It’s not fun to wait for them on the street, while they figure out how to navigate London. If the delivery were free, maybe that could be a trade off.

6. The food never arrived (was it left on the street? Was it given to some random person?) who knows...but the driver entered into the app that the delivery had been delivered. (If drivers would deliver it to the apartment doorstep, at least the correct person would be receiving the delivery.)

7. Now I’m dealing with customer service.. another 30 minutes of my life wasted..and no food to show for it.

I wrote to customer service about this. They responded to my email after two days and promised to fix the issue in 2 days. It’s been a full week and no resolution so far. In addition I would like to point how difficult it is to find any customer support from within the app interface. It has been hidden away under the ‘About’ sub menu of the ‘My Account’ screen.

It is obvious that they don’t want to provide the refund if they delay the order; meaning, they don’t want to stick to their promise.

- So you filter restaurants to only list the ones supporting your card to discover at checkout that they actually don’t on the checkout screen

- When they accept the card many times payment just fails with an « unexpected error » message. With your full order, you just revert to using your credit card and sit on more and more meal card credit :(

I’m hangry and upset. and they say they will refund my money, but they don’t they refund half of the order - some credit I had from a previous order. I can’t make this stuff up. Anyway, After long back and forth, nothing happens and I’m am super exhausted and What a huge waste of time. That’s it. I am switching to another app here on AppStore starts with Z:) looks more professional and there are many options out there. Who has time for what!!!! ———- Deliveroo calls today to understand why I stopped ordering and after looking into the records apologizing the will give me the rest of the refund. 😐 It’s obvious that Customer service representatives are not empowered to make decisions to retain the customer, oops! NOT AWESOME. While I certainly appreciate the effort of the customer service representative who was extremely professional and understanding, doing what’s right after all this time is a bit too late, but I accept it and let’s close this door and I wish you good luck, we are at point zero. Plus I found that the other app here on AppStore are extremely efficient and responsive. They also offer random discounts on good brands. It’s worth to explore what’s out there and not wait until you have a similar experience to mine. Hope you found this review balanced useful and entertaining:) if so please vote it helpful.

4/27/20 18:07,19Jonny71,Issue with delivery address still not fixed,"From the update that messed up pattern of choosing delivery address the app went from good (client experience wise) to a nightmare!

1!!! Besides being forced to place a pin on the map when opening the app, you have to choose delivery address before diving into a restaurant’s menu. Why? Because once you are finished with choosing your meal and want to pay, you either have to put in address manually from scratch or go all way back to the list of all restaurants to find on top option for choosing delivery address. Seriously?! 

2!! Bad things gets worse with rising cases of restaurants first confirming the order and than after unreasonable amount of time (15min and above) canceling it all together because they suddenly figure out that they cannot execute it, that with no future discount or else. We place order, put our phones aside to do other things being sure 30-40 min later food arrives, while instead 15-20 min later restaurants cancel the order. 30 min later we pick up our phones to check where is the food, surprise-surprise, order canceled, order again? No, better cook myself!

3! Why can’t we save favorite restaurants? Why the shortlist with restaurants customer usually orders from has disappeared? It’s bizarre to have to search for it.

This all feels like calling a service line 20 times to get simple things right. Every time you speak to a new advisor who doesn’t know about your previous call or the matter at hand transfers you to a “right person” who continues from where the first call started 🤦🏼‍♂️

if the above issues are so unnoticeable, make your 50+ year old mom or dad to use the app and get constructive feedback for god sake. They are used to doing things in the most efficient and constructive way one by one.",1,FALSE,deliveroo-food-delivery,1001501844,

9/12/19 2:12,Ralph101,Beware of “order failed”,"(I rarely leave criticism reviews.)
I used my Facebook connected account to order in Taiwan, first couple times no problem, then it came “order failed” one after another, the worst thing is that despite they claimed they didn’t charge, my debit card was in fact charged for failed orders. Contacted them, the customer service said my account has unknown issue, next thing I know, this account of mine cannot contact the customer service anymore, always showing “chat unavailable”. I used email to contact, their UK response is I should register for another account, completely ignoring my request for refunds for failed orders. 

Here is my advice for people who are about to use Deliveroo:

1. Make sure the email address you registered is accessible in the future whether you directly made an account or connected using Facebook. Because if anything happens to your account, you won’t get help but only a response of ‘you can ask us to delete this account and create another’. 

2.If you by any chance see “order failed”, and it’s not that the restaurant is close or else, stop immediately, don’t try to order again with the same account. You might be charged for it and they won’t refund since in their understanding it’s ‘impossible’.

Deliveroo has its advantage compared to other food delivery apps: they deliver it pretty fast. But ask yourself: is it worth it to overly rely on the convenience brought by these app companies and card-issuing banks at the expense of your autonomy on your life? The feeling of powerlessness once troubles find you later down the road, where you are completely at the mercy of these corporations that granted you charming convenience, are you sure you want to feel that way over and over again throughout your life? 

I am not going to use Deliveroo again despite its fast delivery. But I thank Deliveroo for waking me up reminding that I shouldn’t count on the convenience brought by others that claim worry-free services. It simply means less autonomy on my side, it’s not worth it.",1,FALSE,deliveroo-food-delivery,1001501844,

3/8/21 6:18,Melrose80,Not Happy !!,"Deliveroo, 

I was very disappointed with my order today. The point of Deliveroo is to make it convenient and accessible. I order many things from M&S late last night and was confirmed delivery for those items this morning, between 
10:15-10:45am. 

They we’re perfect with timing they came on time between 1015 to 1030 but they crossed out 80% of the list out of that which I ordered milk bottles from Marks & Spencer 1.2 L. I ordered 9 bottles and my entire milk bill was canceled (which was the main point of ordering and I ordered the balance stuff to fulfill the remaining amount so it reaches $600) out and they only brought 2 to 3 items one was the dessert one was yogurt and one was the hummus. When you do Deliveroo from Marks there’s a minimum order of $600 each time. And now when you have canceled out so many items from my list and came all the way to deliver just 3 items it brought my minimum order amount down so if I want to order the milk now I have to worry about again ordering more things to reach the $600 bill. Which is not fair. 

You guys are promoting we can get anything we want from our favourite places then you need to fulfill as you are promising. Cannot deliver 1/4 the items. 
If the products are not available in the morning Deliveroo can call and inform us that the goods are not there at the moment and you are waiting for all the goods to arrive and we will deliver later in the afternoon that is understandable & acceptable there is no problem if things are not there and when they refill you can bring it in later.

But not to bring 80% of the order it’s ridiculous.",1,FALSE,deliveroo-food-delivery,1001501844,

Thanks for getting in touch with us.

I was able to ran through your order and it seems that the rider has followed all of the process to deliver the food.
I can confirm that the rider arrived at your location. The rider might have encountered issues finding your exact address which is why he tried calling you 6 times.

Because of these, as much as I want o provide you the resolution you were expecting because we are not able to provide any compensation for this occasion as we are bounded to our Terms and Conditions.

I understand the inconvenience this has caused which I do apologise for.

If there is anything else feel free to let me know.

Kind regards,

Deliveroo Team

I just went and checked with the staff at the front desk of my serviced apartment, and they informed me that there have been no deliveries from Deliveroo. They also mentioned that if I was for any reason unreachable, the delivery would have been accepted by them on my behalf.

No one ever showed up to deliver my family’s dinner! Please refund my purchase immediately! 

	

Apr 21, 10:09 BST 

Hi,

Where is my order? Please refund my purchase immediately!

I have been at the delivery address all day long. I have 3 other family members who have been with me here and are witness to the fact that no one ever arrived to deliver our food to us!

My family and I are now starving and I feel like I've just been robbed. If I have 4 witnesses in total confirming that we have been at the delivery address the entire day and no one ever arrived to deliver our food, how does that stack up against one delivery driver, who perhaps ate my dinner, saying that she/he was here for 10 mins?

There is a constant delivery fee regardless of which restaurant (2.50€ which isn't too bad), and there are no delivery minimums- simply a minor additional charge (I think 2€) for orders under 10€. The delivery times are shockingly fast, often faster than predicted. My bagel from Bagelstein arrived in literally 10 minutes from when I pressed order. Delivery times I've experienced are usually less than 20-25 mins max, even from high-end restaurants. And in my area in Paris, there are a ton of restaurant options, even later at night - from gourmet to quick/casual. It's even helped me discover great restaurants nearby!!

10/21/16 22:10,Pookie and Gummi,Amazing service!,"TLDR: amazing customer service, great app, use it if you are traveling in Europe! DL now! :)

Right after I just shared with my husband how I review so much on Yelp! and TripAdvisor---but never seem to write reviews for apps on the AppStore. We found this gem!

We have been traveling in Europe for a month now from the USA. 

In Dublin, after a wonderfully Guinness filled day we took a nap and it was 9 pm! We didn't feel like leaving our Airbnb and needed takeout fast to fill our stomachs! I remembered seeing Deliveroo bikers in Barcelona, Venice and Amsterdam and decided to give it a try.

I was stressed out because I was not sure if I did everything correctly (which I did not - user error). I didn't input the address correctly-- so the poor guy just aimed in a direction which was really close by!

The app is great it told me when the food was being prepared, where the rider is and the timing for everything. So I dashed downstairs when it was 2 minutes and we didn't see our rider. After a few minutes of waiting I became so stressed because I feel bad when the people delivering do not know where to go. I ran upstairs for wifi and did a live chat with Romero? (Not sure if that was his name) great service! Husband got a call downstairs from the operator who was very professional. They let us know that they had emailed, the rider had called and the operator called again to ensure we got our meal! 

Thank you delivery rider, operator and chat agent! So sorry about the mess I caused! But you've made a wonderful impression! Thank you!! Thank you!!",5,FALSE,deliveroo-food-delivery,1001501844,

(And let's not mention, if Deliveroo was paying their riders enough to live comfortably, they would NEVER need a tip.)

And then there is ""Only on Deliveroo"". This is just... downright infuriating. Seriously. It's an awful practice to keep you on the platform, because otherwise you can't get the food that you love (especially during the COVID era)... and surprise surprise, they charge high fees for those Deliveroo-exclusive restaurants. Absolutely shameful. Oh, and their new ""service fee""? Yeah... that is more than likely just a ploy to rip more money off of your wallet, and this new fee is put out of the way to make sure that you don't notice the additional fees until it's too late :)

Simple answer to this? Use Talabat instead. Deliveroo isn't worth it, and they will only ever change their policies when they realize that Talabat is overtaking them. Speak with your wallet. 

The highest delivery fee I've ever seen on Talabat was 6.50 AED... Deliveroo's ""old"" fee used to be 7 AED, but it now fluctuates around 8-10.50 AED.",1,FALSE,deliveroo-food-delivery,1001501844,

2. If the deliverer came to the apartment, then how come we didn’t see them since we were standing directly outside the apartment entrance?
I told the customer service rep. that I wanted my money back, but instead they gave me credit towards my next purchase. So in the end, they took €30.00 from me and I would have to order from them again in order to get something out of this experience.
