I’ve been a happy and loyal customer with zomato for years! Until this week when 2 weeks in a row I had an issue with my order and instead of fixing the problem they just refunded my money instead of investigating the problem further. The first time the problem occurred I did receive a voucher which I used towards the second order. Then the problem occurred again and their representatives refused to send an additional voucher. Only to tell me my original voucher used would be returned in 2hrs and I needed to order from a different restaurant. So therefore you expect me to wait two hrs to order from a different restaurant and starve my kids til then in order to utilize the voucher. The problem could have been solved by simply gifting me another voucher since the same issue occurred 2 weeks in a row. It was my foolishness to think this problem had been solved and then to think I would receive the same courteous customer service when I did not. In my opinion the representative needed additional training as they were such in a rush to end our chat and care less that I was leaving the chat very unsatisfied! Less learned and I will no longer be using Zomato until they make some changes and put their customer concerns first!,False,Horrible customer service,krlyday,2,2020-06-30 08:51:21,zomato-food-delivery-dining,434613896,
"I stopped using this app when they killed the popular Urban Spoon app, I thought I would give it a look again and wow, what a disappointment.  Why would I use this app at all?

What if the nearby restaurants are not what I am looking for?  It has no more pick cuisine, price range and shake your phone and a cool vegas like slot machine would roll thru food possibilities with sounds and ratings.  Yelp has easy cuisine slider with one click.

"They missed some items from my order and instead of asking the restaurant to correct it they said that they would give 50 rupees in COUPONS to my account. In other words instead of refunding the amount of missing items or delivering them to my house they said they would give me coupons (not even ZOMATO credit) but coupons so that I would have no choice but to spend more money on their site. Their customer service is disgusting. They wanted the customer to bear the burden of the restaurant’s mistake and their incompetence. They don’t even have a helpline they just chat with you and keep suggesting that they will make sure nothing bad happens on you next order. They suggested to me to order from the same restaurant, who had messed up my first order....instead of fixing the blunder that they had made they want me to trust and pay money to the same restaurant again.

"Decent app and user friendly interface but that’s where the quality ends.

He said there is nothing that can be done.  I said I am asking for a refund only if the vendor can not provide the item requested and he can take the product he gave as I am allergic to what he gave.  

The CSR still insisted I accept what given and refuses to do anything else and he went on to stay that the vendor has the right to give any product instead of the requested if they do not have the product they have listed.  

I have screenshot the entire chat session.  The point of the money is not the case it is the principal.  How in the world can Zomato expect a consumer to just accept any product because their partner screwed up.

You can tell from my old review below that I was a major fan of Zomato, the app and it’s service. But I’m unfortunately their service has dropped drastically.
If you order has an issue, you will not get much help, not like it used to be.
Sad to say, but you are better off trusting your food order with another service provider. The app is great for discovery, but don’t get swayed by the deals.
At the end of the day, service does matter.

Old review
Been a long time user of Zomato. It's a great app for foodies and restaurants. It's also great for food bloggers and photographers.
Zomato keeps changing the interface which is annoying at times but, once you get used to it their features starting showing.
They used to have a cashless payment system, which was discontinued unfortunately. It showed great promise.
Their table booking feature and online ordering system is quite nice as well (tho you will find inconsistencies every now and then).
Also the stats seem bloated, I have far too many views on my reviews and pics. I feel like every time someone views a restaurant (even if they don't check the review) it counts as a view. They need to fix that.

Don’t trust to zomato. Horrible customer service and they will never refund you if you not follow them and keep reminding them. I had many similar cases where sometimes restaurants cancels the order and zomato never refunds.

However zomato team called me back right after and told me that restaurant wants to confirm your location and asked to send my location to restaurant!! Really?? What is this???  that’s really fraud.

You don’t look into the root cause of the matter you just offer promo codes which is like insult over injury. the restaurant is not that far from my home in car takes 15 mins in bike will take max 10 mins. it was the fault of your delivery person who is loitering around instead of heading to pick up and then he instead of heading straight back was again loitering around. And you will not take any action against nor did you follow up on proactively when order was running late whereas me and my family on other were sitting around mobile following up on the order because we were hungry and more importantly my child was hungry.

"I gave this app a try when they took over for urban spoon years ago. I was unimpressed how they got rid of many of the features I used to decide where I wanted to eat, what was nearby etc. 

This app is prevalent in India, and many of the restaurants that don’t have websites only have their menu here. I was annoyed that I could not look at Zomato online, they made me download the app. So felt forced into using the app. Then tried to be objective on my thoughts about it. I didn’t see any features noteworthy over what I could find over just using a browser. Plus, you are kicked back to the home screen every time switching to another app. It all seems like a racket to get people to register.

To find out if the order has been placed or not, I tried chatting with their customer service - their service is a joke. The chat window says ""chat will start in 1 minute"" and you wait for eternity with no response.

Tired of waiting for confirmation, I had to resort to other service and 2 hours later Zomato delivery guy arrives with food and no notice. The app still says ""order pending"" at that time. The delivery guy was equally frustrated with their app and they claim this happens all the time.

I've been trying other apps like Swiggy and they get their job right - timely order confirmation, keeping you always informed and comms between restaurants, users and riders.

The new version has limited and/or useless options (no filter for take out?) and they’ve removed any ability to edit/update listings.

The vallet’s vehicle broke down and I had to go to him to get the order. Which is fine because sometimes stuff like this happens. The worst part was that the food was ruined and I had to still pay for delivery and food. ZOMATO did not take blame or did not support me in any sort.

3. The Deliveroo app is a lot more responsive and easier to use. Very clean layout.

4. The Zomato riders always struggle locating my apartment even though my instruction are very clear. The Deliveroo riders always get it right all the time. The Zomato riders don’t bother to read or understand the delivery instructions. They always get lost, go to the wrong property.

"I encountered both of these incredible and efficient people just for 2 different orders from one same restaurant (surprisingly). First time, I received literally burnt, inedible, complete black chicken from Japang. Immediately, called the number from the receipt, the guy from restaurant’s call center promised me to deliver just the chicken ( I didn’t even asked anything more from my set menu since only all the chicken pieces came wrong) which I paid for it after asking me the picture and evidence of their burnt chicken from WhatsApp. As believing they will deliver the new one, I didn’t order any other food and fall asleep, wake up next morning, the chicken was not here. That’s where I met with Radhika from your team who is very efficient and helped me to get my food back although it took two days because I contacted the restaurant first. But my boyfriend is insanely in love with their chicken which I admit too, we kept ordering again and again until last night, the order were never arrived to us. Payment was done from my card, the restaurant was still opened when I ordered my food but nothing came to us or informed us. Just took money and marked as delivered after an hour. Again, Sharad is helpful, friendly, very empathy for us. He promised us that he will bring this issue to respective team but I just want to make sure my zomato experience smoother and more convenient. You guys definitely need to action needful control regarding with food and service when it comes to the restaurant from your side. At the end of the day, it’s Japang restaurant which I ordered through zomato, not just the restaurant name. Amazing experiences that I fought two days for chicken two times.

"I was already upset with the restaurant cancelling my order. On top of that, I kept being told from the ZOMATO customer associate that I dealt with, that ZOMATO isn’t accountable for this and all they can do is raise a complaint. There was a lot of defensiveness in the associate’s tone, lack of empathy and left me feeling let down from all ends. ZOMATO has to reconsider their customer service approach and offer short term solutions rather than just say a complaint will be lodged. This is not the first time a complaint has been raised to ZOMATO and no change has come out of it. Orders continued to be canceled after being accepted and the blame is on the restaurant but ZOMATO doesn’t seem to want to change the policy in preventing these cancellations from happening and not impact their customers.  We, customers continue to experience bad experiences like cancellation of orders due to either various restaurant’s reasons or ZOMATO not having delivery staff. It’s absolutely baffling that the associates fronting the job to calm customers don’t come across as empathetic nor seem patient to understand the underlying need for change in policy from ZOMATO’s end to prevent cancellation of orders to happen. Instead, like today, we’re stuck with a back to back chat with an associate who was more defensive of their current policy and seem almost irritated with the customers for raising up concerns and wasting their time. Overall, bad experience all around. Just disappointed with the whole experience and how things were handled by zomato",False,Bad customer service experience,UnhappyCustomer04,2,2021-09-25 10:59:12,zomato-food-delivery-dining,434613896,

"I gave a review that I received a wrong order from the restaurant, when I called the restaurant, they weren’t able to help their customer. The restaurant name is BelBalady, UAE. After a few days later, I get a mail from Zomato that they have taken down my review saying it’s not the restaurant’s fault and there was error occurred from Zomato’s end. So it’s not right to penalize the restaurant. Fine if that was the case, did you think about the inconvenience the customer faced in all this? You take down my review and give the wrong order. If Zomato considers serving their customers as their first priority, it’s shocking to say their actions speak otherwise. I have sent numerous emails to the Zomato help desk. Followed them up for the past 5 months, wasting my time describing my experience, my detailed description of the order and the Order ID and I get no response! It’s like all the emails from their customers are directed to their trash box. All I wanted was a refund for the inconvenience faced but NO Zomato doesn’t care about customer experience even though it’s built on that very foundation. All it cares about is showing a pretty face on the Internet that is the best food delivery service out there. But there are lot of great competitors who are doing a  better job! 
 
I wonder if the are even paying attention to their customer reviews given here. Because all I see their developer’s response is share your Order ID and detailed review via mail and everyone’s doing that but Zomato doesn’t respond!
I have even contacted the Zomato Community and the UAE help desk. Such terrible Zomato service in the UAE? Unbelievable. I expected more.

"Feel free to share this one!! 

Well, all I can say is you DON’T want to eat at the Frisch’s Big Boy in Somerset, Ky!  One of the worst experiences I have ever had at any restaurant in my lifetime!!  I will NOT step foot in there ever again!  I am not one to complain, normally!  I DON’T send food back to be prepared a second time, because I am afraid someone will do something to my meal, but this experience is worth raising awareness!!  Too much happened to go in to great detail, but to make a long story short, we found a hair inside our turkey wrap and the waitress witnessed my daughter disposing of the bite she had taken. She immediately came to our table, picked up the plate of food , and said that she would have them remake the sandwich. (Which was nice of her, ) but my daughter had already lost her appetite, so we ask them if they would just take it off of the ticket, because she wasn’t going to eat it and didn’t want to take it home.  The waitress told us that she would sure ask her manager. She came back to our table and said that he says that he isn’t able to do that. I’ve then asked to speak to him, and he came out like a raging bull!!  Management was so rude about it, as if it were our fault! They were screaming at us in front of the few customers that they did have, and we left the uneaten meal on the table, with our blood pressure through the roof....and still had to pay for the meal that we couldn’t even eat! Management informed us that their policies wouldn’t let them do anything about it to make it right! Very unprofessional management with ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! They even insinuated that WE were lying, even though we showed the waitress the hair inside the wrap!! All this over a $4 wrap?!   Really?!?!?!?!

This post isn’t at all about the money! We wouldn’t have even told the waitress about it if she had not seen my daughter’s reaction to the hair when she took the bite!!

"Absolutely Horrendous service from your service agent Mr. Abisheik , I had placed and order with Gourmet Burger and accidentally forgot to change the payment option from Cash on delivery to credit card , I proceeded to place the order only to realize later that I had chosen cash by mistake . So I called the restaurant and they said it was fine and that they would bring the CC machine . I receive a call from Mr. Abisheik from Zomato later with the most rudest and aggressive tone of voice and I stop him before he continued & explain to him that I had already spoken to the restaurant and that CC payment was fine. His intention was to notify me that it was not possible . I then proceeded to tell him that I did not appreciate his time of voice and that I would file a complaint , he then told me that my voice was quote “ bothering him” !!! , really ? Is that how you train your customer service team to speak to customers ? . When the driver arrived with the CC machine I refused to pay until spoke to a supervisor, I explained what happened and asked for Mr. Abisheik to apologize before I made that payment , the supervisor then called and told me that he ( Abisheik ) had left his duty for the day supposedly. Then promised to have him call me back when he returned but until now over 12 hours later nothing has happened and frankly I do not think anything will happen as this is typical of your service , poor service which is made evident by your employees behavior . Absolutely appalling and I will be sure to share my feedback with everyone I know including the Dubai customer service body , the dubai economic department ! .

"I’ve been using Zomato for more than 5 years, in the last 3 years the service kept declining.

The customer service representative have turned into a complete scripted robotic responses, no matter what you will say the response will be scripted even if it has nothing to do with the problem you’re facing.

I’ve faced my share of bad services in many apps but this one took it too far.

I’ve had many orders that were wrong, missing and delayed for 3 hours.

Yet their response was, the driver is coming, the restaurant received the right order and sent it right, there’s traffic or too many customers at the restaurant. There’s always a problem/excuse with them.

All of these were complete lies just to keep you waiting, I’ve asked many times to be connected to their superior or supervisor and they kept sending generic responses then ending the conversation before I could reply.

I’ve had a friend check the restaurant place to see if there’s a lot of customers there since my order have taken an hour and there was no progress at all. He told me that the restaurant is half empty, I’ve asked him to check if there’s any delivery driver standing by, he told me there are none.

From what I’ve gone through, they will tell you bunch of lies to keep you waiting, even if you tried to complain or ask for order cancellation or a refund they will tell you it’s not possible and wait for the order it’s coming for you.

One of the lines they always use “I’ve called the driver and he’s with your order and coming now, 10min and he will be with you”
2 hours later and there is no progress, no delivery no nothing.

Today, after an hour and a half, the driver sent my order to my neighbor, normally I wouldn’t be mad, the driver dropped it off, I checked the app and it shows that the driver dropped it in the wrong location. I’ve called the driver to ask him where is my order, he said he have dropped it off at my house, and gave me the wrong address, keep in mind that it took more than 5 minutes at my neighbor house. Now this became a health hazard because I honestly don’t really know my neighbor and I don’t know if they had an interaction with or living with a COVID patient.

Now, If this was before COVID, I would just accept it, but the food might have been opened then closed.

Once I received the order from the driver, I spoke with Zomato representative and told him/her the story.

They called the driver to confirm and ask him few questions, when they got back to me they said the food was not opened so it’s safe.

The food could easily be opened, there is no safety sticker, or any anti-tamper.

Zomato representative wasn’t listening to me at all, they were trying to get rid of me as soon as they can, they sent me multiple scripted messages that has nothing to do with my requests. 

They kept repeating their food is safe and hasn’t been opened. The food spent over 5min at the neighbor house as I mentioned before.

I don’t want to say all, but I’ve seen too many drivers with their mask off or below their noise. It’s a health hazard to us the customers and the restaurant staff.

Do your self a favor, delete this app, it’s not worth your money, time and health better drive to the restaurant and order it by yourself.",False,Worst service. Health hazard. Scammers and liars,D.Emperor,1,2021-09-11 10:33:58,zomato-food-delivery-dining,434613896,

"Zomato used to be a great app when it was first launched. Even got better as time went by but for the past 6 months the whole thing has just been quite garbage. 

The new UI is just annoying as opposed to their old and smooth look (was easier on the eyes). 

Their customer service was great, especially their chat function. But since the app became popular, they just automized their CS with the same old robotic answers. If I screengrab my Zomato chats, they’re literally plagued with the same responses. So the human aspect of chatting with someone is gone. And they no longer have local customer service reps. They have outsourced it to India for cheaper labor and if anyone does call you to enquire further, they’ll direct you to a customer care email address where they “might” be able to serve you better. 

Their whole payment structure is slowly crashing. 40% of the time I get double charged for ordering food and when I ask the online chat (please bare in mind I get the same automated answers), they blame it on a gateway issue... gateway issue has been a problem for just about 5 months now. Something like this should be fixed. All the people I know have been having the same problem. And then they’ll tell you a refund will be issued with 2-7 days.. how is it my fault that you can’t maintain your app? Why should I have to wait for a refund? Surely my bank was able to deduct funds from my account for my order, but there is an issue with the gateway between the bank and Zomato. Why should I have to pay for that? 

Either way. I used to support this app and was actually giving you positive word of mouth until recently. From now on, just going to say how garbage this app is with support from the above comments. Good try guys. Was a smart idea but you grew too fast and now you can’t handle it. Great way to lose customers.

"I've been using Zomato since they were formally Urbanspoon. I have to say it's a must have app. It has truly changed the way I look at planning meals and especially traveling to new or out of town cities.  The program works great and is very simple to use. Anyone that says otherwise probably shouldn't be allowed to have a phone or computer.  There is an international presence which is great and already has me thinking where I'd like to travel to next on an culinary adventure abroad. I wish more people would sign up and participate in the United States as new restaurants have to be added by members for the most part.  Zomato may not be used as much as Yelp around my surrounding 500 miles, but the quality of the reviews overall are much better and criticism is done in a usefully way.  You don't see the ""haters"" on Zomato just posting negative reviews with no real reason.  Like I said, this app really has changed my life for the better and gets daily use of my time because it and its members deserve it.  Why eat bad food or spend your hard earned money on it when Zomato can help you find quality, great tasting food, good service, comfortable atmospheres, & great experiences.

"Like most people, I was initially very disappointed when Zomato absorbed UrbanSpoon and thus ended the reign of my favourite restaurant review app. While the app still has room for improvement (for example, it seems difficult to browse or search outside your neighbourhood on the app), I've grown to appreciate the app and use it daily to determine where to eat. The bookmark function and option to create your own ""collection"" of bookmarks is really useful for remembering which restaurants you want to try in the future. Also, the app has its own collections of restaurants, like hidden gems and great breakfasts, that come in handy. I also love that you can give restaurants half-stars in reviews. In Abu Dhabi, my current city, the database of reviews is usually sufficient to decide whether or not to try a restaurant. While I'm still mourning UrbanSpoon a little bit, Zomato has done a reasonable job at taking over what UrbanSpoon used to do, and it's still the app I turn to for restaurant recommendations.",False,Grow to like,Budding polyglot,5,2016-02-21 12:04:52,zomato-food-delivery-dining,434613896,
"Like a lot of the people reviewing the Zomato app, I am a former Urbanspoon user who used the Urbanspoon app quite a bit and really liked it.  I have really come to like the Zomato app a lot, but like most people who used to use the Urbanspoon app, I was at first pretty dissapointed.  I had become very familiar with the Urbanspoon app and now, poof, it was gone and I now had to find my way around something different. But after having played around with it for a little bit,  I am actually very pleasantly surprised. Sure, there are a couple things I kind of miss about the Urbanspoon app, but the Zomato app has some really cool features that Urbanspoon didn't. Overall, once you give it a chance and become familiar with it, I think you'll find that it really is a great tool for deciding where to eat and discovering new restaurants and bars. Is it perfect? No. But the first version of the Urbanspoo app wasn't perfect either and got better and better with each new version they released. So I'll definitely be using Zomato as my go to app for dining and I'm looking forward to seeing what new features they roll out in later versions.",False,Former Urbanspoon user pleasantly surprised,GregJ206,4,2015-06-11 02:44:48,zomato-food-delivery-dining,434613896,
"Here's the deal- I want to find a Thai place nearby.  Urban Spoon got me there with minimal effort.   Zomato makes me give up after wondering around like Jodie Foster's character in Silence of the Lambs whilst Buffalo Bill (Zomato) watches her feel around for the walls in a dingy, pitch black hole (this app).  This app is absolutely atrocious.  I get the distinct impression I'm being driven to certain restaurants.  I also get the distinct impression the only reason to keep this app is for instances when I want watch a dumpster fire burn.  I haven't hated a changed product this much since...no, this is the gold standard.

We also just moved to Denver and it has helped us weed out some of the restaurants in our neighborhood. For example, I drive by this place on my way to work daily, looks good, cars in the lot, nice patio, etc... Anyways, within the last few months some regulars were being routinely dissatisfied with food quality and service... Now I'm going to give it a couple of months before I go and hope for some improvement! It also helps find those ""not much to look at"", hidden greasy spoon gems that only locals know about!

"Yes, I am yet another disappointed Urbanspoon user. Urbanspoon was an important (5 star) app for me -- especially when traveling -- because of the ability to easily filter search results for ""gluten-free friendly"".  If there is a way to filter for gluten-free friendly or gluten-free options, the developers have managed to hide it extremely well. I tried searching for gluten-free on the Zomato website and found it substantially easier to deal with. On my iPad. Unfortunately, I don't generally walk around with my iPad but use my iPhone and I am unsure how well that is going to work,given the difference in screen size. So basically I've found a workable although not totally convenient solution. One that does not include this app. And since apps are all about convenience, I would say you (or at least I) don't need this app. 

PS I admit to taking the demise of Urbanspoon a bit personally as I am on a gluten-free diet for medical reasons.

"Many reviewers have complained about the apparent step down from the urban Spoon UX. However, their complaints, while not wholly unfounded, have been largely subjective. The problems presented by reviewers have mostly focused on navigation, layout, and intuitive interface challenges. These are elements that will frustrate some, and not concern others at all, and the full diversity of reviews bears this out. My problems are not based on taste or UI preferences. This app is just buggy as hell, in this current iteration. Render gaps, functional errors (if you try to review a restaurant it won't let you publish said review until you rate the restaurant first. But the rating capability is not available unless you exit the review and rate separately. Then, once you have rated, the review section still requests that you rate!).

You have very good ratings for ihop and outback and places like that.  Those are not GOOD places to eat. At least not for anyone who actually appreciates good cuisine. 
According to this app there is no fine dining in Waikiki. Ridiculous. Of course there is. But according to this app, the finest dining you will find (or at least the highest rated) is a noodle shop. It may be good but it's not ""dining"". That's just eating. 
If you think P.F. Changs is fine dining then this app may be for you. If creativity, inspiration and a meal that's not just simple sustenance is your thing, stay away.

This new version and UI is just awful. I find myself giving up and flipping back to Yelp and all the snotty reviewers there. It’s really frustrating when a company takes something that works well and destroys everything about it that was good and worked.

Now, you can no longer search by ambiance, ratings, cost, food restrictions, etc. You can barely even search for normal restaurants on Zomato because it's all just social media based (very poorly done), plus who wants to be on social media when trying to use an app to find something to eat?!

2. Although Zomato notes that all locations have been transferred from Urbanspoon, several locations near my location were not noted in the app.  This caused me to wonder what other locations may have been omitted.

Wrong! Less than half the restaurants how up in this app compared to Urbanspoon. It's kinda sucky that when you search near me you get a shortened version of restaurants. That's probably because it just searches for 2 miles around you while urban spoon searches for 10 miles.

"I agree with most of the negative reviews. I was a loyal Urbanspoon user for years and was very satisfied with the layout and utility of the app. I could not understand why they changed the name to something as nonsensical as ""Zomato"". I could ask someone, ""have you tried the Urbanspoon app?"" and within a few moments of hearing the name they would get it. With Urbanspoon I easily understood the rating system. For me if a restaurant had more than 50 votes and was rated 80% or higher it was worth going to. Now I have no idea how the new system works. Intuitively it seems to not have a wide enough scale. What does 1-5 equate to on a scale of 1-100? I also loved the Wishlist feature. I think I understand where Zomato was going by changing to Bookmarks and thereby using a standard Internet / computing convention. Even so, it's not so obvious where I want to eat vice where I've eaten. I have to go through a step or two to display the data.

All of the above being said, it does seem like the team at Zomato is paying at least a modicum of attention to the complaints. Photos are better, Dineline seems to be back and this app may end up being something I will continue to use.

I also agree with the reviewer who said that not having access to the years of personal notes they made on the restaurants is more than disappointing. It makes you wary of investing time in any app where you don't explicitly own the data or have a way of easily exporting it. The app developer creates a ""free"" app then makes money by selling the information they glean from users to businesses in the industry.

"I was an avid user of urbanspoon, and like everyone else I saw the notification of them
Merging with zomato. Out of curiosity I downloaded this app to try it. Well let me tell you that I was not pleased. Zomato has a much more complicated and not so stream lined interface unlike urban spoons. I feel like on an iPhone the search results have very little screen real estate, and all other crap crowds it. I was able to view several restaurants a time before now only 2!!! at a time vs urbanspoons 5-7. I only want to know name of restaurant, rating, distance, and price. If price, cuisine, and rating fit my bill I'll CLICK on it to check out reviews and pictures of food and further details!!! You don't have to throw all of that out to me on first impression. Point is that it takes me forever to get through the list of restaurants. STOP giving prices for 2 people. I just want a dollar sign reflecting the price point for 1! Not everyone going out to eat is a couple or maybe I have more than 2. I don't want to have to divide the sum and then multiply that with number of people in group. Yes, it's silly and it is basic math, but I shouldn't have to do extra math. Also, seeing a $150 vs $$$ makes me think more about the money than the food/experience. Lastly, stop giving me retardants from one selective area for nearby I don't live at the edge of water. I have restaurants surrounding me.  They are not all located in one specific city. All gripes aside. There is one thing zomato did that I liked and that is their draw ability. You can circle an area, but even then they allow you to only draw in an overall small area of the map. Since, they make you zoom in quite a bit on the map to draw the circle.",False,Undo the move urbaspoon!,Ninanti,2,2015-11-18 17:53:16,zomato-food-delivery-dining,434613896,

"So, I'm not sure what most of these people are talking about on the App Store. I think most are just former Urbanspoon users who are resistant to change. 

Honestly, Zomato's search and filtering system just makes sense. I have lived in two Zomato markets, both India and now in the United States, and I can't imagine living in a new place that didn't have Zomato. 

People just need to understand just how FILTERABLE the data is! There are so many data points, accurate filters, to customize your search!

If I'm in Denver Colorado, want to find a place around me, with a Gluten Free menu, with outdoor seating, that's open in 45 minutes from now, I can find a plethora of options, photos, hours, and real images of the menu on Zomato. 

Oh and I can arrange an uber from within the app too.

In Dallas, Texas, when I'm looking for a place that takes reservations for a group of 12 with specific cuisine, I get every option I could want.

Yeah, the app is constantly being improved and new versions are frequently released, but I think this shows responsiveness. The only thing is wish is that The information on Zomato was consistent across every city in America. That'll come with time. 

Until then, I'm glad to have Zomato on my phone and it'll stay by my side as my restaurant search app. HUGE app for business or leisure travelers, with a consistent presence in 22 countries.

"Hi there! My name is Amber, and I'm a former Urbanspoon user. Many of the current reviews yield very low ratings and complaints about how the Urbanspoon app has moved over to the new Zomato app. I've read several of these reviews, and it seems that the developers have as well, making improvements along the way. But what is really causing all the fuss? Are there actually less features on the Zomato app than there are on our beloved Urbanspoon app? Or are we, as a society, simply afraid of change? I dug deep to discover the differences-and the similarities, between the two. 

The Home Screen:
-The main screens of Zomato and Urbanspoon are quite similar. What you don't see on Zomato though, are options to discover hot places around you, say, in San Francisco, if you live in the Bay Area. The ""late night"" option under ""Open for"" is also removed from the main screen, as well as the filters for price. But the price options have been moved to precise filters later on, when you're actually searching. The ""Shake"" option, which gives you a random location, cuisine, and price range has also been removed.

Searching Nearby:
-When you search nearby, say Sacramento, California, the Urbanspoon app displays 100 search results, while the Zomato app displays 51 at a time. This isn't in an attempt to show less results, but rather to load locations more quickly. You can still refine your searches, and  the filters on Zomato are actually more extensive than they are on Urbanspoon. On Zomato, you have the option to ""Sort"" by distance, rating, and cost; you can choose breakfast, lunch or dinner; pick a cuisine; select an establishment type (i.e. bakery, café); select a price range; and even select other refining features such as gluten free, wifi, live music, outdoor seating, sports bar, and BYOB. You have the option to find restaurants with a minimum rating of 3.5 stars, and ones that are ""Open Now."" The Urbanspoon app only has options for price, cuisine, location, Open for, and a couple of sorting features. Personally, I really like the filter better on Zomato. 

Social Features:
-Zomato brings a whole new social vibe to food. I understand why people might be apprehensive about the new features, that allow users to post reviews and photos in order to share their experiences and ""level up"" on the ""Me"" tab. People don't always want to share their information. It's either tedious, annoying, or simply private. The incentive here though, is to give people a reason for sharing reviews. It's to create a quality database that the community can actually rely on, from peoples' honest opinions. I'd like to know a little something about a new restaurant or café that I'm considering trying for the first time, and the social aspects and opportunity to ""level up"" encourage people to share. However, if you're absolutely not a social person, you can ignore those features completely. Additionally, you can add friends and view a sort of feed, to see which places they recommend. You can easily read reviews and view ratings on Urbanspoon as well, but it isn't ""friend"" based. 

Conclusion:
-While some features have been replaced, you gain a really extensive filter, and can see recommendations from friends. There are some additional social features, and as far as functionality, the Zomato app definitely passes. Both apps are visually pleasing and easy to use. 

So, at this point, it's really up to you! Really weigh the pros and cons. People are afraid to try new things, or don't like when something that worked for them in the past is altered. If you can get used to a bit of a new layout though, I'm sure you can find the Zomato app to be just as useful.",False,A Very Analytical Review,Emberlite,4,2015-06-21 17:23:49,zomato-food-delivery-dining,434613896,

Alas, Zomato has become a victim of its own success: its pages are cluttered with the cloying and sycophantic screeds of for-hire publicists. To find honest reviewers you must look to the number of views, and ignore the Zomato-awarded foodie-rankings, designations (""Verified Reviewer"" must be translated from the Orwell, see below)  and the number of followers, all of which can be and are actively manipulated. As an example, one of the most respected and widely followed critics in Dubai, with just under 60,000 views as of Dec 2015, is ""ranked"" the  #4156 foodie. Zomato is largely to blame for these Frankenfigures, because it actively calls out and identifies critics by name, and then invites them for free meals and drinks at the restaurants' expense. If this is not a conflict of interest, if this is not the reviewing equivalent of a GMO, what is? Zomato has surrendered its editorial integrity to its admen; it serves Mammon not God. It need not be so. There is still time to be good. 

The heirloom way to remain as objective as possible is, of course, to eschew Zomato's own designations ('Verified Reviewer' means 'highly manipulated, bought and paid for with lavish free food and drinks, and by no means anonymous. ""Verified"" my tush!) Honest reviewers must rely on their views to gauge their effectiveness. Zomato permits this, but it seems to do so reluctantly, pushing this category into the background and featuring the banal and meaningless ranking prominently. Interestingly, every restaurant owner we have discussed Zomato reviews with looks first to the number of views, and expresses contempt for ""Zomato pimped girls"" who gorge at the restauranteurs' expense in exchange for reviews seen as increasingly dilute in their effect. 

On the other hand, it is an easy to use platform, and its graphics are graceful and they enhance the viewers' experience. To Zomato's infinite credit, we know of no editing or manipulation of reviewers' texts, though We hope and suspect that they have edited out profanity and obscene statements. 

Technically (vs. editorially) the site is a marvel, loads easily and makes ex temporare and in depth reviews easy to post. It is by far the best app, technically speaking. We also deeply admire the continuous technical improvements and added features (online ordering, etc). Why does the editorial side lay marinating in its own torpor? You say Zomato and I say Tomato, let's call the whole thing representative of one set of values. 

Zomato would do well to change its transparently self-interested ways, and also establish a channel for serious reviewers to re-visit and re-review the restaurants. Shamefully, there is no distinction on Zomato between a good and a bad review; between honest reviews and tales told by idiots, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

"Urbanspoon was my ""go to"" restaurant app.  Zomato is a complete downgrade.
The guy that tells you there's some cool features must work for the company. Here's what I dislike:
1.  Zomato wants WAY too much personal information to access the system.
2.  The location services does not work well. When I input ""current location"" and a specific food type, the app displays restaurants that are 20 and 30 miles from me and doesn't show restaurants that are close by??? 
4.  There is no map to display were restaurants are located. As a frequent traveler I relied on the map so I could see what was in walking distance. 
5.  The rating system is not as easy to read as Urbanspoon.  I loved the percentages and would often cross reference information with Yelp. 
Urbanspoon was always 
more accurate and very easy to read.  Zomato eliminated the percentage rating and is back to a 1 to 5 rating - NOT an improvement.
6.  Zomato doesn't seem to have a complete restaurant database. I am confused by this because they acquired Urbanspoon which was very complete, even in smaller towns.  I can't believe how many restaurants Zomato doesn't display in my immediate area. Then again, it doesn't seem to know where I'm at. 
7.  This app is NOT intuitive or user friendly. 

Overall, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this transition and will rely on Yelp until Zomato gets their act together.

"Epitome of dissatisfaction. 
This is the first time I have ever put forth the, albeit minimal, effort involved in reviewing an app. The not insubstantial amount of time and effort, therefore, shall stand as testament to the utter contempt I hold for Zomato. In the roughly seven years since picking up my first iPhone, I have yet to use anything remotely as disappointing as this app. If zomato does one thing correctly, it is that it performs as I feel the developers intended it to perform. The design, however, is the most horribly thought out amalgamation of user interface with which I have yet had the displeasure to interact. The home screen is mostly taken up by an advertisement for a ""recommended"" restaurant. Who or what is recommending I do not know, nor do I know the basis upon which it is being recommended. 

Another complaint I have is that zomato incessantly tries to backdoor Facebook data. Now call me paranoid, but I'm not a big fan of having all of my data shared between applications like its some sort of sex craved nymphomaniac. I prefer my apps to operate in solitary independence. Nor does it appear to ever take a hint. No zomato, after all of this time I didn't suddenly change my mind, I don't want you to now intertwine your electronic tentacles with all facets of my social media. If I want to know where my friends are eating I will ask them directly, thank you. Seeing as how the majority of the other options on the home screen are inaccessible until you provide unlimited access to your Facebook account, I am unable to speak as to those functions. I will however bring up two points of contention. The first being that, if I do indeed want to see a picture of what Johnny Appleseed ate for lunch, I will do what all other Americans do; view it on their Facebook, Instagram, or whatever the current mainstream social media app happens to be ""in"" that week. Secondly: If everybody kept their promise to not share my email/data with other sources, why do I get so much spam. So no, you're not getting my email address. 
Zomato's primary function is to enable me, the user, to quickly and efficiently find food, and find it close. While not a perfect app, I like to think zomato's predecessor, urban spoon, came pretty dang close to perfecting this simple task. What we are stuck with now is a travesty. 
Let's scroll down to where we can find restaurants nearby, because as someone who travels quite often and unanimously without a car, I need food that is relatively close. I'm not sure how zomato interfaces with a phone's gps, but I do find it interesting that any other gps based app can register me as being pretty darn tooten close to where I stand... Zomato, it thinks I'm off chasing butterflies a quarter mile away. Utterly useless. So let's try to tell the app where we are, you know, like you used to be able to do with urban spoon. Oh yeah, not happening. Zomato does have this cool option to draw a circle though. Apparently the app caters to hungry people who would rather not venture into restaurants on the wrong side of the train tracks, if you know what I mean. Too far out. Zoom in, too far out. Zoom in, you get the point. It's not like you have a car and can drive any distance. Also, what is the point of drawing a circle if you are going to be shown restaurants outside of the circle. 
That is to say, restaurants within your circle don't always show up. Why not you may ask. Well that is because the in-app location for many restaurants does not correspond with where the restaurant is geographically located. What use is a map that lies?
Zomato's icon features the silhouette of a spoon to convey to the user its  purpose. I suggest a more appropriate symbol for this app be a lemon. This allows zomato to continue its food reference while more accurately alluding to how miserably defective and unsatisfactory it's user interface performs.

"It is a shame when a once fantastic restaurant goes horribly wrong. I took my family to #LBOneRestaurant last night (July, 23, 2016), and I wish I had not... This establishment used to be top notch and it is obvious they are struggling big time. To begin what was a horrible night, they overcooked my Mother-in-law's steak into a tough mess and after a few tries they got it right. My wife had what was supposed to be a 10oz. Lobster Tail, stuffed with delicate crab meat, she took one bite and was in shock... I tried it, and agreed it was horrible.... The tail was covered in a mountain of Cayenne pepper that was SO nasty and rendered it completely inedible.... This is an American restaurant that tasted more like a bad Mexican experience... Our food tasted like it was assembly lined and not cooked by the chef we originally ordered it from at the window....

The staff was scrambling and took the tail away however the replacement tail was worse then the first.... It was tiny, (not even close to the ten ounces they advertised). It was small and old obviously ORIGINALLY frozen and reheated... 

It is appalling that you are restricting the amount of salad a customer can eat that supposedly comes along with their dinner that they are paying for. By not allowing a customer to bring home and box up his/her uneaten salad, it is obvious that LB One Restaurant is FINANCIALLY UNABLE to replenish an all you can eat salad bar and satisfy their customers. Even more appalling is that you don't allow the customer to take home an uneaten salad that they have paid for and then THROW AWAY PERFECTLY good food when people in the USA and abroad are starving. 

Avoid this place and call Gordon Ramsey perhaps, as this establishment needs serious help.... It was a once thriving, special and wonderful restaurant that seems to be the victim of the economic collapse of Atlantic County.  Sad.

"I’ve used this app a few times. Last time my food was late by an hour so they gave me a coupon code to apologize. At that time I thought it was nice. I used the coupon on my next order which was only around half of the coupon value. Next day I wanted to use the reminder of the coupon amount but it didn’t work. I contacted them on the chat and they told me it was a one time use coupon and they won’t give me another one for the remaining amount. They didn’t tell me I couldn’t use the coupon until I use all the credit they had given me.

"Every once in a while, I will get a Zomato email saying my food has been delivered when it has, in fact, not been delivered. Usually it does show up eventually, but it makes it clear that 

1) the app has no guarantees that you WILL actually receive your food if the delivery agent says it’s been delivered when it hasn’t. 

Your option then is to do what I did- enter into a lengthy and frustrating back and forth with the customer team. Here they will pacify your with a code for Rs. 400 off you next order. This is the best part-

2) THE CODE DOES NOT WORK.

No customer ask zomato for free order... it’s zomato who says get in 45 min delivery or get it free advertising.
This is completely false campaign fooling customers. Bz if they don’t deliver on time then zomato won’t give it for free. Zomato will say since we didn’t deliver on time we can’t give order for free as we advertised but will say RS.200 off or something for next order with in 7 days.
Zomato doesn’t know the term get it free.. they will say conditions apply.
My point is not on getting it for free.. no customer asks for free order .. I m against these false advertising to attract Customers and not fulfilling it.

Because, everything is good till it’s not. You run into some problem. Your order is super delayed. There are hungry kids getting more and more “hangry” by the minute.... and you are too!

You try to get help but the Zomato bot is so poorly programmed that sometimes there’s no option for your issue. It lies and says you’re connected with a person but it’s just a bot. Does Zomato think it’s users are so stupid that they won’t know it’s a bot?

Messages sometimes take over 2 minutes to be received by the bot. And then it takes even longer to get a reply.

On the chance that you may actually be connected with a person who will chat with you, the responses are so canned that you can tell that they are rigidly following a script.

"I’ve order from this location on multiple occasions and each time there has been a discrepancy with my order. I ordered salads on two separate occasions and they were delivered without utensils. The first encounter I went to the neighboring establishment and second time I contacted the restaurant and it was delivered. I ordered from this establishment on 04-19-2018 and ordered two large pies as a treat to my coworkers. I ordered the “pile up” due to being allergic to green peppers I requested the pie without green peppers. The pizza arrived with green peppers, I contacted a male representative of the store, who appeared to be a manager, he argued with me and insisted I said “onions” not green peppers. I commented verbatim “No sir, that’s incorrect, you repeated no green peppers and no olives”. I went on to explain “I’m allergic to green peppers, have been my entire life I’m definite I said no green peppers”. The rep then angrily yelled into the phone I know what you said don’t order from us anymore and hung up the phone. I visited the location to return the pie I could not eat and request a refund and he continued to be rude along with another male member of their staff remarking “you guys get a 50% discount if you don’t want green peppers you should pick them off....clearly not comprehending the difference between “allergic” and dislike.

"Update 11/21/2016. Just tried to pull up reviews on Longhorn Steakhouse in Hanover, MD. 5 reviews!  Good deal...from 2012. Yup. Really current!  Remains 1 star. Less if I could give it. 

Update 11/17/12016...so, I'm on a long term consulting project in Maryland. Decided to get pizza. The app found one anywhere nearby.  Ok. I'd buy that except I'm a half mile from Arundel Mills Mall and the Live Casino. I pass half a dozen places just going there. Yelp gave me 18 nearby (EIGHTEEN!) and 5 that deliver. If I could give zero stars, I would. 

Update 6/13/2016...found a nice review posted yesterday for a great sushi place I like to go to. Trouble is, it became an Indian restaurant about 2 months ago...the Indian restaurant isn't to be found. 

Ok...I had 30+ reviews on the old Urban Spoon app and used it often. Zomato, not so much but I still try to use it and I've put in a few reviews but, it seems harder and harder to find restaurants. Granted, I'm looking in some fairly rural areas but, really??  Today, I looked for a Greek restaurant in La Plata, Maryland called Galazio. First, Zomato told me it was in La Plata, DC. Now, it is close to DC but, I assure you, it's a good 40 miles to the District from here. And, even searching in La Plata, DC, the restaurant was not to be found. It does have 40 reviews on TripAdvisor, 36 on Yelp and 215 votes on FaceBook. And not even listed in Zomato.

This app has an identity crisis. Every time I do the update something major has changed, something has been removed or made even more convoluted. The ""been there"" option has once again been deleted so there's no longer an option to check that or rate solely with stars... write a review is only option to keep track of restaurants dined at. Please, please, Zomato. Listen to these reviews, get it together. Urban Spoon was such a useful app. You're trying to reinvent the wheel but not in a helpful way. I'm once again not going to use this poorly designed app
April 18, 2016
I was finally getting used to Zomato after mourning the loss of Urban Spoon and the other day I 
did the update for this app, thinking improvements had happened but no. in fact it's regressed. One thing that was actually useful for Zomato was the ""been there"" check option button, along with the button for rating solely with stars. These were convenient, especially if I didn't feel compelled to write a review or if I didn't have the time. Now they're both gone. I tried to simply rate a restaurant just now, wondering if it would appear in my been there list but it wouldn't let me simply assign some stars without writing a review along with it. Frustrating. Wish I knew this, I wouldn't have bothered with the update.Zomato! Get it together. Read the complaints here.  All the features, functionality and interface options of Urban Spoon made it popular for a reason. I have no idea why you're  trying to reinvent the wheel here. And doing a poor job at that.

Original review:
Why can't I see the restaurants I liked / didn't like? Only those reviewed are visible. Urbanspoon's system allowed me to keep track of hundreds of restaurants I've eaten at. As someone who travels frequently it makes it my go-to when looking to return to those I liked. I'm not opposed to Zomato but needs to integrate all the functionality of Urbanspoon to make it worth using. A lot of reviewers here state they deleted or will start using Yelp if these issues aren't fixed.

Unlike Urbanspoon, this app can't tell me the closest restaurants near me based on my actual location. I'm really missing having every single restaurant in the vicinity being shown with an easy filter based on cost, distance, and rating. 

Seems like it would be easy when the developers own both code bases to merge the best of Urbanspoon into Zomato. Zomato is just not intuitive enough. Also, it seems like the listed restaurants are far fewer than what Urbanspoon had available. 

Is there any good reason you can't just leave Urbanspoon as a standalone app? It was far superior to Zomato.",False,It's not Urbanspoon,Ryan1144,2,2016-01-02 22:23:05,zomato-food-delivery-dining,434613896,

It has gps to navigate what's near by or you can manually put in a zip code you can also change the categories from default (all) or choose specific cuisines you'd like to choose from.

Most annoyingly, the address info is inaccurate just often enough that I can't trust it. I always wind up Googling it...at which point I could get reviews and menus there, so what's the point?

I delayed reviewing 6 month to make myself get used to the new interface, but nothing doing. In the search results you can only see 1 1/2 restaurants at a time...very bad for scanning through to find something that sounds good, I'm also not a fan of the 5 star rating...once things are averaged, everything's rated... well...average.The % liked model seems to give results that feel more meaningful to me.

Truly terrible. I ask again, have any of the designers ever eaten out? Travelled? Understand what a restaurant is?

As a graphic designer I'm a visual person and this app is the equivalent of dry toast. That said Zomato has taken a visually and useful app and squeezed the good stuff out.

The one down the street that I already go to, the purpose of a search is to find all of them, and there are several. The gaming aspect is ridiculous.  I fear this app is going the way of the ""GetGlue"" app, a truly fun and useful app bought out by some big company, then run into the ground and is now gone.
