1) Setting up Payment- there seems to be no way to set up a new payment option (new credit card) without first trying to purchase something. If you go to your personal profile, you can see your payment options, but there’s no way to edit them! What the...? You can delete them, just can’t add or edit. Sooo...you order something, then click payment options, THEN you can add a different card if you want. Not easy in a hands free world when I’m driving to work, approaching my garage and want to quickly place my order before I park and head to the coffee shop. What am I missing???

2) someone recently gave me a gift certificate to that favorite coffee shop mentioned in 1) above. On the back of the gift card, it’s says “powered by Toast”, and there’s even a scannable barcode. But guess what? there’s no way to load the gift card into toast. Soooo....while I have this cool app, and I have this gift card to my favorite coffee shop, all powered by TOAST, I still pay for coffee at my favorite coffee shop with my old credit card, and I’ve got 50 bucks sitting on a gift card I don’t use because my coffee is all paid for (on my old card) when I get there.

There’s no FAQ or any information about “ToastTab”, or how it works prior to placing an order. You’re expected to blindly create an account and then (somehow?) set up payment. But I don’t really know because I can’t learn about this product before using. 
So I set up an account using a throwaway email address. (I had little choice). There’s still almost nothing listed to learn about this service. They have a section called “Payment Options” and it says “No saved cards”. That makes sense because I have yet to place an order. So I click that section and …nothing happens. A little arrow turns as if a drop down box was meant to appear or something but that’s it.
Sorry, not using “ToastTab”. I have no idea what they’re about and they offer almost zero educational on boarding assistance or FAQ. Feels clunky.

Then, at checkout, there’s no Apple Pay support, and again, it breaks autofill so I can’t have iOS fill in my credit card details. And there’s not even an option to use the camera to scan in my credit card info. So, I have to type that, too. All of this means there’s a serious amount of friction involved in placing an order.

2021-09-28 03:25:54,2,Gooseday,"Comparable to the other big delivery services as far as navigating restraints, menus, and selecting options. I’ve only used for takeout and, strangely enough, table-side ordering. Does it’s job there.

Where this app/service falls flat on its face is auto-fill and payment processing. 

First: auto-fill fields are not properly assigned and will prompt with incorrect auto-fill options if any at all. Not a huge problem but since you would only use auto-fill for setup it isn’t a big deal.

Second: Apple Pay is presented as an option at checkout but the “Pay with Apple Pay” button has zero effect. No error message, no authentication check, nothing but a slight color change to let you know that you have your finger on the button. When searching the in app FAQ the last mention of Apple Pay was a beta back in 2019. Is it implemented or not? It should either work or be removed from the app.

Third: Some restaurants in my area use toast to process payments made on premise. This was the most frustrating experience I’ve ever had in a restaurant. We were seated and given QR codes to start ordering. Not a problem, just different. 

Scan the code, select my order, click submit and get prompted for card information. Here’s where it all goes down hill. I enter the card information and get hit with a $0.01 hold as if it just opened a tab but then it errors out. Retry again, new $0.01 charge and the same error. Try again with another card, same story. 

The rest of my group has already ordered and some already had appetizers delivered by this point. Had to flag down one of the three employees who then had to get a manager. I finally get my order entered by the manager after the rest of my table already has their food.

At the end of this ordeal I had to go on a hunt for the manager just to pay my tab. A terrible experience, powered by Toast.

Long story short, the app works okay for takeout but if I walk into a restaurant and get handed a card with a QR code that pulls up toast, I’m walking away.","Mostly usable, agitating bugs",False,toast-takeout-delivery,1362180579,

— all of these food delivery apps have this, it is the gold standard. 

Not knowing where they are can cause confusion when trying to receive an order. I’ve had people end up at completely different buildings and have also had delivery drivers get lost. 

This type of implementation is crucial for a successful business model. You’re losing a lot of money by not having this: think of all the refunded orders for upset customers because their food couldn’t be delivered in a timely manner (cold food) or all the lost orders because person ordering couldn’t find courier.

2020-08-08 23:22:55,2,Halfabubbleoff,"Using this app is fraught with frustration.
1) logging into this app, it emails you a verification code, but when you go to check your email it logs you out and your verification code is useless.  This chicken and egg scenario is only broken if you can access the app on one device and email on another device.  And honestly, should be using an authentication app instead of email authentication.  
2) The app recalled that I had placed an order with a particular restaurant previously, so I went to add those items back into my cart, with the intention of making a small modification to the order.  So went to add the one new item, and when finished, the previously added items were dumped and I only had the one item I had just ordered.  So, had to manually add in the other items I wanted.
3) While the app shows all the additions that can be made to an order, there isn’t anyway to remove an ingredient.  The only option is to order something else.
For other restaurants, other apps have worked far better and easier than this app.  I gave it two stars because I at least it took my order after about 10 minutes navigating the interface.",Difficult app to use,False,toast-takeout-delivery,1362180579,

Ordered and surprise- no $5 off. 
Contacted customer support. They told me I should have entered a promo code. I sent the pics of my receipt showing no promo code. Matt in customer service decided to no longer respond. 
I got an app “verification” code but no $5 off. Talked with owner of Lu’s sandwiches he said the App is responsible for money credit. Not Lu’s. 
No $5 credit offered for a do over by Toast shows they’re not a serious business.  If they offer $5 and the transaction fails, shouldn’t they really still honor it?
 I guess not.
