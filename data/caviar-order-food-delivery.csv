5,False,Mixed feelings,2020-09-17 17:12:58,"Caviar used to be a great app. Top quality restaurants, working app, good service. But they recently merged with DoorDash which I have found to be a notoriously worse app. Since the merger, the app seemed to change and your delivery drivers are now from “Dashers”. When you order now and have an issue and try to chat Caviar sometimes their servers are down or you can’t get a hold of them. Your left to call the restaurant who may tell you your food has been ready for a half hour but DoorDash/Caviar hasn’t picked it up and is unreachable right now. Typical DoorDash problems. Although the app needs work and the DoorDash merger is disappointing. When I finally have been able to reach the company and explain various issues. Caviar does issue refunds and credits. This is a positive that some apps like UberEats or Postmates rarely provide. Caviar’s credits/refunds are close to the high level of Seamless/Grubhub. Only reason Seamless/Grubhub are better in this area is refunds and credits can be issued automatically in the app with ease if you run into issues. Caviar, as mentioned above can be difficult to reach and requires more explanation. Ultimately if the Caviar app improves the accessibility of their customer service and they continue to provide credits, I would consider changing my review back to 5 stars. On the other hand, if I keep running into these app issues or if they stop providing credits and refunds for issues I would lower the rating. I’m on the fence.",Good64774,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
2,False,"Unreliable, Unhelpful",2020-05-20 18:18:53,"They have such a great selection of restaurants but service is SO unreliable! I have ordered maybe 5 times through them and the last three have all been really frustrating.

The last time I kept calling saying that the driver’s location on the map was not updating and the estimated delivery time kept getting pushed back. The customer service people would just read the estimated delivery time and disconnect the chat without ever reaching out to the driver. Two and a half hours after my food had been picked up and still not delivered, I finally figured out that the driver had car issues and the order was cancelled (3+ hours after being placed). This same type of situation has happened two times other times with the driver having car issues after picking up my order and getting here super late with food that has been sitting out in a car for at least an hour after being picked up, and customer service just doesn’t really do anything to figure it out or get a replacement order sent. I get that car issues happen, but three times in a row with this app isn’t a great track record considering that this has NEVER happened with competitor apps. 

I was really excited when I found Caviar because of the really great selection of restaurants, but I ended up deleting my account after this last time.",weterpest,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
1,False,Deliveries take too long,2020-11-04 00:18:24,"Well for the last six months understanding pandemic aside because Uber and seamless are doing the same and they are not as late as they are and you are able to reach them, they apologize and always find the best solution or at least give you a credit to make it worthwhile. Caviar support team is easy on saying goodbyes, take a long time and then get back to you with no answer or problem fix, so for the last 10 or so orders all close by restaurants from my house, I waited about an hour to find out the driver was lost and was calling me in Spanish or the driver never showed up, and mostly I had to basically cancel the order and re-order again, I am finding out that the only way to get an order is to first order and then contact Support to make sure they are reaching out to somebody to get your food picked up, I can’t be using an app as such and always waiting around an hour and sometimes get my food cold because it’s been out there so long or never get it and re-order. The worse is customer service that basically tells you it is what it is, goodbye because they have to help somebody else. Knowing seamless GrubHub and Uber eats they always try and they always give you some sort of credit to make up for it immediately before you even asked for it to try to alleviate the problem. Caviar never does until you force their hand.

1,False,Horrendous customer service,2018-12-24 02:52:21,"I would say the app experience is superior to other delivery apps, which is a shame because the customer service is terrible. 

Our expected delivery time upon ordering was 8:24 pm, which eventually got pushed back to 8:49 pm. The app notified us of the delay, which is better than other food delivery apps in which I’ve experienced delays but wasn’t notified. However, when order finally arrived, my husband noticed the delivery guy gave us the wrong order. Turns out he had given our order to the wrong person. Driver says he’ll contact support, saying they’ll probably re-deliver. I contact customer support on my own, and the rep offers a refund...okay, but at this point it’s past 9 pm and we still haven’t had dinner. I reply back saying it’s not okay. Rep blames it on me, saying that I selected that the items were missing and I preferred a refund. Except there are no options for “my driver messed up, get me a new order asap”. Eventually he offers $10. Their twitter account offers me $30, saying the restaurant is closed, which is why a re-delivery wasn’t available. 

The correct response would have been to offer expedited delivery form another restaurant. At this point, I am not going to use this app again and will not recommend this app to my friends. Note to the developers: there are other food delivery apps out there, you are the new guy and you need to do more to stand out besides offer different restaurant selections.",anogawa,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,"{'id': 6547062, 'body': ""Thanks for the feedback and I'm so sorry to hear about the issue you've experienced.

1,False,Never received my food,2018-05-21 07:53:18,"After ordering my food I got a call from the delivery guy saying he was at my gate. I buzzed him in while I was on the phone with him, and I heard the gate open. Then he never showed up. I received an email that it was delivered, so I called and called and he didn’t answer. I tried contacting customer service but there is no number to call, so I was limited to texting and emailing them. They took ages to respond to each text and email, and they eventually closed without giving me any answers. The last thing they told me was that they couldn’t get a hold of the delivery guy and they didn’t know what happened to my food.

I had guests at my house who ended up leaving without dinner because they had a plane to catch and everything was closed after all this ridiculousness went down. Caviar didn’t even offer a refund, I had to demand it. I demanded something be done about what happened as well and all they’d do is give me a ten dollar credit. The customer service is AWFUL and you cannot rely on this service to actually bring you food. I haven’t even received an email or anything confirming that I will be refunded. So who even knows if they really did issue me a refund. I just read other reviews and it seems food not being delivered is a common theme with Caviar. Looks like they make it way too easy for drivers to steal the food, and then they blame the customer for it. I will never use this app again.",Sassoom,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
1,True,Bad Service for the Outrageous Delivery & Service Fees,2019-06-04 00:34:55,"UPDATE: I contacted customer service as directed below. The short answer is, they aren’t willing to refund orders, it’s against their policy. Even if it shows up over an hour late (nearly 2 hours after the order was placed) and is cold and soggy- I’ve already gotten more than one credit for poor service. What I want is my money back. I informed them I’d be deleting the app, and got a canned response saying we hope this experience doesn’t reflect badly on them. I am deleting the app and will be ordering from DoorDash moving forward. DoorDash is now picking up many of the restaurants that were once specific to Caviar, they’re timely, and their fees are lower. I’m sorry Caviar, I tried. 
. . . . . . 
If the food ever got to me in a timely manner, or even lukewarm, I wouldn’t be complaining. That said, nearly every time I’ve ever use this service, the delivery time increased from the posted 45-55 minutes, to 1.5-2 hours. That’s ridiculous. I wonder how they treat their restaurants as well because more than once I’ve received strange inaccurate orders- for example, a salad will show up bare (just a container of lettuce, minus any of the listed ingredients from the site), or most frequently, anything I add on as “extra” to a dish I get charged for, but the “extra” isn’t included. I’ve requested refunds, with no response.

1,False,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE - don’t use!!!,2020-05-23 14:54:56,"Right as the pandemic was starting I used Caviar for the first and last time when one of my favorite restaurants only participated with them to place an order.  My order was shorted a sandwich, when I called the restaurant they said they couldn’t reimburse me and I’d have to go through Caviar. I contacted Caviar immediately, they initially directed me back to the restaurant. When I said the restaurant had told me go to Caviar because they couldn’t reimburse and now the restaurant is closed, Caviar said they would look into it and get back to me.  Five days later and still nothing so I emailed their customer service again where I got the same runaround even though I copied their previous responses the rep hadn’t clearly even bothered to read my whole complaint.  This time they said they’d love to help BUT I’d waited too long to contact them and anything past 7 days couldn’t be reimbursed!! I responded back and attached previous convos of how I contacted them immediately and any hesitation was on their end. They assured me they’d look into it and get back to me so of course I never heard anything again.  All this over a $6.99 sandwich which I never received - had they reimbursed me right away I might’ve given the service another chance.  Now not only will I not use them but I’ll tell everyone I know not to use them either.  Lesson learned - stick with the other apps!",oldskoolgeek,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
1,False,GIVING UP ON THEM,2020-04-25 15:40:14,"Being that we are in the middle of a pandemic, I have tried to support local restaurants while still keeping them safe by ordering through caviar. Twice I have ordered from our favorite bagel shop that is two blocks away from us and my order has gone horribly wrong. The first time it took an hour and a half and we hadn’t seen our food yet. We couldn’t find anyway to contact caviar in a timely manner so we cancelled our order. 

Today we ordered bagels through them again and this time after an hour wait it said our item was picked up and on its way. Then it said delivered and we checked the front door and our food was nowhere to be found so we were worried it was stolen. We called the restaurant and they said our order was still with them. I completely understand long wait times given the circumstances but don’t lie to me. Why would a courier say our food was picked up and delivered when they haven’t even arrived at the restaurant yet. That just leads to confusion and is infuriating. After we spoke to the bagel shop,   Caviar apparently called them and the shop reported what the courier did and she told me they were very rude and dismissive to them. We ended up getting everything cancelled and ordered directly trough the bagel place to pick up the food. But it was a total waste of time and incredibly frustrating.

1,False,Horrible app run by careless company.,2021-02-23 23:46:54,"So I wrote a review about DoorDash since they banned my account for no reason, offered no help in reactivating it, and we’re not able to provide a reason as to why I was banned. Come to find caviar is owned by DoorDash, and even though I have only used caviar ONCE, they banned my account too. I “chat” with a customer service rep and they too, are unable to give me a reason as to why I am banned. I am just told that I “violated their terms and conditions” but what part?  What did I specifically do? I am a 22 year old female who has only used the app to order food. I am not some hacker stealing free meals from this service so I don’t understand what I possibly could have been banned for. I ask for a phone number to speak to someone directly and try to get my account working and they straight up tell me “they don’t have a phone number at this time”. How do you not have a phone number for you customers to reach out to?? Especially when you are banning their accounts for no reason?? Absolutely ridiculous how they have zero lack of care or sincerity when it comes to their customers. Even if they somehow deactivate my account I will never be using DoorDash or caviar again.

1,False,"Very 1st Order, not so much",2020-11-24 00:42:00,"So I decided to give Caviar a try, and was swiftly disappointed. So I place my order for some Korean food at 3:09 pm. I get the confirmation email from Caviar saying that the restaurant has received my order, and to expect it by 3:45 ish. So I go about my day, until after 4 pm and realize that nothing has been delivered. So I check the App and it says that my food was already delivered the exact same time I placed the original order.  

Thinking that is very strange, I contact CS to find out that they immediately canceled my order (with the excuse of saying) that my order was never received by the restaurant. I get more run around about some other details (like trying to get all the charges/tip get refunded and making sure all credits will apply), until 15 minutes later I had only a credit of $8, and I had to reorder everything again or forfeit the I was money owed. 

This just doesn’t seem fair to me. Caviar did apologize for the mixup, but they never took ownership of their mistakes or tried to go above and beyond (especially during these times. ) I normally wouldn’t be perturbed by this, but due to the pandemic I can only get food from delivery since I’m immunocompromised. It’s hard enough trying to afford all the fees and charges with these services. I just came away feeling used and upset.

1,False,DoorDash has destroyed the perfect app,2020-08-29 00:16:09,"The world is on fire, and Caviar used to be a lovely corner to snuggle up in and feel like I was treating myself. It was by FAR the best food delivery app out there, and I admittedly order a LOT of delivery. But for some reason, DoorDash has decided after acquiring Caviar that they should blow all of that away and just make it into another DoorDash.

This new version of the app is HOT GARBAGE. Look, I work in tech, I understand that making a whole new app is a huge undertaking. But how the did a bunch of product managers sit down and decide to make THIS monstrosity? How did they decide that customers wouldn’t mind that their entire order history and app data would be blown away? How did they decide to remove a ton of useful features instead of adding more? And in WHAT UNIVERSE do people not want to be able to scroll through a whole menu instead of having to individually click into each section?

It’s silly, but having a delivery app I could count on was really, really nice during this nightmare of a pandemic. Sometimes you just need a small win to get you through the day. Am I disproportionately sad that the Caviar I loved is gone? Yeah, maybe. But read the room, Caviar. This is not the time to be a dick to your customers.

But after several years of on going issues and subpar customer service I have to say that the convenience of having local food delivered through Caviar is no longer worth the headaches. For the last two years or more I have documented every issue that’s ever arisen. I feel it’s important especially for companies to be given feedback in order to improve and I certainly do appreciate those who take the feedback and make measurable change. Caviar, despite there tired line about taking your feedback and “rest assured it will never happen again”, has failed to do this. From delivery windows changing dramatically post order, missing items constantly, and either their sorry excuse of service recovery ($5 credit on your next order) or worse yet, the complete lack of response from customer service, they will no longer receive my business. I’m sad that these folks are able to actually deliver on the service they promise, despite all these hiccups, they’ve probably received plenty of business from me, and it would have been a lot more if they would have figured it out.

Caviar doesn’t provide a way for us as courier to contact them either . Whenever there is an issue they just send the pre set answers . They don’t pay us what the jobs say they are going to pay so most of the time we get about 3 dollars a job even tho the app will say more . They never update customer info so a lot of the jobs will be late or not show up because the app has the wrong address or the wrong number . Also it works on some kind of algorithm they say which sends us the jobs super late during the peak hours of dinner and lunch . That app usually crashes during these times so that’s why the food is late or never gets there . If the app says the food has been delivered and has not that because as couriers we can get in contact with caviar to deal with any issues so the quickest way to get a job of the screen is to hit complete .

Caviar touts itself as an upscale delivery service allowing you access to delivery from restaurants that you can’t get anywhere else and charges prices (delivery and service charges) to match. My first few orders I was okay with this because I could get food delivered from some pretty wonderful restaurants...then it all went downhill. My last few orders have been nothing short of disastrous, and the worst part of it has been the customer service. Rather then helping or problem solving, they (barely) apologize and blame the restaurants. Today, when our food arrived late and stone cold they were flippant and passed off blame to the restaurant, even though their app said food was out for delivery for 40 minutes AND it was delivered not in a hot bag/case. After quite a bit of back and forth, they finally relented saying they would give a $5 credit to “make things right”. And that was it - after overpaying for cold food that was here well after it should have been.

1,False,Has Fallen Off A Cliff,2020-05-30 11:07:43,"There is really no upper management that resolves serious problems. For several months, restaurants have been listed as available and they aren’t even open. Worse yet, the system allows you to place an order, pay for it, and expect delivery as if it were open. Only when the time comes for delivery and your order doesn’t arrive does Caviar finds out the restaurant is closed. Or at delivery time, Caviar just cancels your delivery without explanation. Customer reps never give an honest response about why these restaurants continue to be listed as available and not removed from the list. They allude to management. Management, whoever that is, never takes control, and remedies the problem. Caviar ends up giving you a worthless $10 credit which hardly compensates for any of their huge fees. Last night, I placed an order at a restaurant that was listed as available and was given a specific delivery time. At delivery time I received no delivery.  When I inquired, the customer rep replied that  my food was being prepared by the restaurant and would be  delivered shortly. Another customer rep replied that the restaurant had closed early.

1,False,Delivery people let your food sit while picking up other orders,2021-05-09 21:16:06,"I used to love this app when it was done by Caviar. Now that they have partnered with DoorDash to deliver the food the service has dramatically dropped. Dashers are allowed to pick up your food then go pick up other orders while your food sits and gets cold. Expect long delays. My last order took almost 2 hours from when I ordered for it to be delivered. My dasher picked up my food then went to pick up someone else’s order and sat at that location for over 50 minutes waiting on that persons order. My order was almost $70 and when I reached out to support about receiving cold inedible food that went into the trash I was offered $24 in credits! After stating nothing but a full refund was acceptable I was offered a credit or refund of $40something. It took having to threaten a chargeback and a supervisor request to get a full refund.

Caviar and DoorDash here is a suggestion for improvements (if you read these) as you have just lost a customer that orders from you almost weekly with average orders being $40+. When a dasher picks up food it needs to go directly from the establishment to the person that ordered the food. Dashers should not be allowed to pick up another order until the one they have has been delivered.",Freakthezeke,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
1,False,Beware of the service - it’s terrible!,2018-10-14 03:39:43,"App appears to work well, hence the two star rating. The actual service stinks. We tried the service on the way home from vacation, because I didn’t want to sit in the car another 12 min to grab our favorite pizza. Delivery was set for 25-40 min, which seemed reasonable. Got a text 40 min later that it’s being delayed another 15 min. 30 min later, still no pizza. Got an update that the driver was finally at the pizza shop. 15 min later called the pizza shop who was just then making the order. Apparently they rejected the order but Caviar never let me know that. They ended up putting it in when the driver was there. Wish they would have just called - I would have cancelled. We still don’t have the pizza yet - it’s due in another 10-15 min, over 2 hours from when we placed the order. What a joke. I will not be using this service and can not recommend anyone else use this.

One of my favorite Dominican restaurants (shoutout to Puerto Viejo!) only offers delivery on Caviar so I had it re-installed. I’m used to the Uber Eats interface but man I love how Caviar always has high quality pics of the food. I also noticed the subtle UI/UX enhancements with the text on the buttons and even the ability to “gift” meals during checkout- really neat! Food delivery “gift giving” is definitely a thing so I thought it was very good how that’s a legit option on the app now. One thing I didn’t like was how longer menu categories have a “toggle to see more” functionality now. I get that it saves screen real estate but I missed it at first and was wondering if the restaurant condensed their menu. Other than that, really happy to be back on this app and thanks for the generous 50% off new user promo :P literally coming back because of Puerto Viejo but the app is so nice that I’ll try to use it more than its competitor, haha.

I received no alerts that orders were made and only found out when one of the orders was not able to be fulfilled. I've contacted Caviar via email and their website multiple times (since they have no phone number) and have not received a response. It is absolutely WILD to me that they don't have systems in place to catch suspicious orders given how often they are hacked. Moreover, my home and work address were also compromised since they were stored in the app. To refer just people to their banks to dispute the charge is incredibly inappropriate since it was not my credit card that was stolen, it was YOUR PLATFORM that was compromised.

2,False,Customer support is terrible or non existent,2020-05-21 14:18:25,"Have ordered many times with the app but in the past two days we had three orders in a row with major issues, including orders out for delivery getting halfway to my house, veering off course, then stopping at a midpoint for 15-20 minutes before continuing. (Midpoint is conveniently at another restaurant). This led to cold food because of a 30 minute commute (read:30 minutes AFTER being picked up under a mile away)

When contacting support i was told that while the delivery was beyond the estimate it wasnt large enough to warrant a refund and the chat was ended by the agent. I didnt ask for a refund, i was trying to discuss multiple issues with the app (one previous order was ‘delivered’ but never arrived because the driver never picked it up and i needed to go to the restaurant and get the food even though i paid delivery and tip...)

I understand times are odd now. And issues can be caused by drivers, restaurants, or the app. But caviar is the face of this. And this is their business model.

The only phone number you can find online immediately hangs up on you when you push the button for support. Then, the “contact support” page has no sign of assistance since it tells you to email them and then that email says they don’t check that email. There is no way to contact the driver either. I contacted the restaurant directly. I placed an order at 6:18. The restaurant confirmed that the food sat there for 45 minutes before it was picked up. Then, when it was finally picked up, the delivery time was again increased by another hour for a restaurant that is 13 minutes away. The driver’s location continually drove further away from me and the time climbed. The only explanation was that he was dropping off other orders before mine. The company clearly does not have enough drivers since the food sits ready at the restaurant for so long and the drivers don’t come straight to you but drive in the OTHER direction.

I contacted the restaurant, who tracked down the driver. “ oh they said you never answered their phone.” The driver never called. After the driver said he would redeliver my food, nothing ever showed up. Again the restaurant was called. “Caviar will give you a refund” but guess what they don’t. No phone number for customer service, only emails with a bot. No way to refund and reissue the order together, despite the fact that you employed a driver who lied about delivering food twice. And when the food was redelivered, the driver was given no thermal bag to keep food warm. Which is great when your driver delivers on a scooter in 20degree weather. How can you be expect to scale when you don’t even equip your staff with minimal technology that was created in the 1980s??

Multiple changes made: name change, delivery address added, phone number changed - all things that should be red flags if fraud monitoring is in place. Realistically if my phone number is changed in the app I should probably need to verify that change via email. The order was placed (lobster delivery to NY) and I found out about it via a status update to my email. I immediately contacted them through the app and always asked for several verifying pieces of info. Upon giving them my account was nuked and I was told if I’d like to use caviar I should signup with a new email. (Lol) No way to make sure there weren’t other fraudulent orders, contact support with a ticket associated with the account, get confirmation the account is actually deactivated.. etc. Just K BYE.

2,False,Caviar murdered by DoorDash,2020-12-18 19:25:38,"Caviar used to be the best food delivery app by far: great restaurants, almost never any problems, and customer support was amazing when you did have an issue. However, now that Caviar has been bought by DoorDash, they’ve migrated Caviar to the DoorDash platform such that the Caviar app is just a rebranding of the DoorDash app. The experience is now far worse and reliability is way down. Unless you want to risk going hungry, I recommend using Uber Eats instead, which is much more reliable.

Caviar will happily accept an ASAP order and then do nothing for multiple hours. The app might show that the restaurant is “preparing your order” but nothing is happening. If you contact customer service, which is annoying with their poor interface, you might be told that the restaurant is closed or refused your order or that they couldn’t find a Dasher. In the meantime, you’re hungry and you might have missed order cutoff times for other restaurants. This has happened repeatedly with multiple restaurants.

So I tracked down a phone number and called and was told by an incredibly unhelpful representative that my account had been deactivated “for a reason” but that “the reason could not be disclosed because it is company policy not to disclose reasons.”  You read that right: They will delete your account, they won’t tell you that they deleted your account, and then when you manage to figure out how to contact them so you can ask why they deleted your account, they won’t tell you why.  They told me they would review my case and possibly reverse their decision, so I asked when I could expect to hear the decision and was told that they “could not promise someone would reach out” to me.  Like I said, I had been a loyal customer for years.  I was worried about losing my account.  But I quickly discovered many other apps have the same restaurants (and lower fees!).

We're forced to wait multiple hours only to get a lackluster phone call from the delivery guy saying our order was picked up by someone else.  We were given no answers as to why Han Dynansty gave our order to someone else.  When I contacted customer service I was met with pisspoor service that offered me a 15 dollar credit and still no food.  No thanks.  I'll just use that to get an uber to pick up my own food because I'm capable of rational thought, traveling from point A to point B and aquiring my own food. 
Another time we waited for an hour to then get a phone call saying that the restaurant was out of our order, then proceeded to make us wait another hour.  When we finally recieved our food it was NOTHING like what we ordered.  I have a food allergy and I had no idea what the food was.  Needless to say I went hungry both nights.  
I am extremely dissapointed in this service and I will no longer be a customer.  It is far easier for me to just walk to the restaurant and pick up my own food.  Maybe I'll try uber eats.

So, you would think that after you cancel an order within less than a minute of ordering, that you would be refunded immediately, right? Nope! I contacted Caviar customer service over the app and it took them hours to contact me back! I cancelled the order at 9:55 am and a customer service agent contacted me back at 2:50pm. I ended up calling customer service over the phone before then, and all they had to offer to me was “The refund was given on our end but won’t be processed until 5-7 business days.” What?

I asked if they could provide a credit in the amount of my order total so that I could at least get my food at this point. They’re not authorized to do this. I asked if I can speak to someone who is authorized. No go. So frustrated that I hung up on them. Next calls will be to our banks to contest these charges.

1,False,They Haven’t Earned the Caviar Name,2017-11-09 23:34:36,"I’ve ordered from Caviar more than once, and usually the food is good. However, their premium service is far from meeting that bar. I finally stopped ordering from them the last time I had an issue with the delivery driver. 

The driver was lost and asked me to come and meet him, but couldn’t tell me where he was. Once he found the building, he asked that I come to the lobby because allegedly the call box didn’t work when it clearly did (as another delivery driver from a grocery service had no issues on the same day). So I come down to the lobby only to find no driver and no food. Apparently he left the delivery and took off, and of course someone walked off with what I ordered. What was Caviar’s solution? Refunding the delivery fee and nothing more. I complained yet again and their answer was to tell me it’s my fault for not meeting the driver in time.

Honestly, they should consider changing their name to fish sticks because Caviar is a premium name for a premium brand, which they clearly aren’t. At least when I’m disappointed by Postmates, I didn’t pay $10 extra for the privilege.",jsnyp,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

I have friends that are quick couriers that have tried to get delivery jobs but apparently they are always fully staffed yet no one can get a meal on time...I’m not sure if the drivers are juggling multiple cab/delivery services or what but I wish caviar would check on the drivers more and hire more efficient people devoted to their service and their service only. I’m pro work for everyone but it seems like a lot of drivers are also maybe not from around here and are maybe also just getting lost.

Now, orders are late nearly 100% of the time, usually because the courier is delayed on his way to picking up the food at the restaurant, so your food just sits in bag dying on a restaurant counter for sometimes hours.  What’s worse is that customers service is now totally unresponsive.  They can only be contacted through email or “text” but it can literally take 5 or more hours to hear back from them at times.  Clearly, they grew too quickly and need to hire more couriers and customer service reps.  But with the problems now dragging on for years and getting worse, fast growth is no longer a valid excuse.

After trying to use Caviar and overlooking its many flaws, I’m deleting this app. The app seems to be about extracting the most labor from the most vulnerable and poor people.

Here’s why I think that:

The default tip for couriers is 0%. Default means most people will choose this option. The other options are 5%, 10%, and other. Couriers should get 20% by default. Caviar presumably does this because their service fees are so high and this is their way of hiding that fact. It’s a terrible practice and a dark pattern that is hostile to its couriers. 

I’ve had so many bad experiences with Caviar. Sometimes a courier will just text without calling that they are at my building and tell me I was unavailable, forfeiting my money and food. I’ve had my food taken by a courier. I’ve waited for 2 hours before only to have my order cancelled. I’ve gotten my food after 1.5 hours totally cold. I’ve had a courier never show up to pick up my order from the restaurant. I’ve had a courier roam around the map in strange ways that makes me think they are delivering for multiple companies trying to make ends meet.

Recently caviar updated the app such that you can no longer determine whether or not a restaurant is open from your “recent orders” menu; a user-hostile update if ever there were one. This app just keeps getting worse and worse. 

Caviar was recently bought by doordash, so I no longer trust that they are not stealing delivery tips. The app still *claims* that 100% of the tip goes to the delivery person BUT: since doordash has proven more than willing to lie about this in the past, I’m assuming they are still lying about this. 

This app is only slightly better than grubhub, and still: profoundly unreliable. Main problems are:

- restaurants *constantly* cancel orders well after they are placed, leaving you to scramble to find a suitable alternative. This occurs so regularly, that I am surprised when it doesn’t happen.

- when a restaurant accidentally omits a major item from your order, you are only refunded the value of the item; despite the fact that you have a totally incomplete meal that you never would have ordered otherwise.

I told them we didn’t want it as we already ordered another dinner and they were kind in saying don’t worry, to enjoy and again, they would not  charge.

When I contacted caviar to confirm the refund they said their system can’t process a refund because the food was technically delivered and I can enjoy a $10 credit on their app. I tried to explain the issue and they said “they get it but can’t process a refund.”

So we ended up sending over $200 for two meals, one of which (from caviar) we threw out and couldn’t even share with my doorman bc #Covid.

Definitely not worth it anymore. The ""discounts"" they send in emails for $10 here and there often don't even cover all the fees. I'm deleting rn. Grubhub/seamless also raised fees (and made them harder to see in checkout) but at least not to this extent. The search feature is also ridiculous. Can't easily search based on fees and actual cost you can afford. I put ""$"" and still got results that had $7.99 delivery fees.

The app shows that your order was “accepted”. You call the restaurant 30 min later and they still haven’t received your order. Let’s say the restaurant miraculously got your order. No guarantee it will get picked up. This happens so often that it seems these guys are just rolling the dice on finding a delivery person.

8:26 email Caviar

I’m now two hours in, no response past the initial hour late response, and of course no food. 

Is this a one off might you ask? No, this is not the first time this has happened and every time it happens it’s like pulling teeth trying to get in contact with Caviar.

When your business model is instant delivery than you had better have instant customer service, ESPECIALLY if you’re charging fees on top of normal delivery fees.

However, I HATE their app layout so much that I am writing the first app review I’ve ever written. There are no advanced search features, no ways to pick a category of food or price point or delivery time or “open now”. 
I think this app would be highly improved with the addition of advanced search. I’d love to be able to search by distance, food type (Thai/Italian/Mexican etc. But also breakfast/lunch/dessert), open late, dollar signs, delivery fee.

All you get when that happens is a credit. There’s no one available to make sure that the missing items get delivered.  Also, apparently the delivery people are not trained to check the orders to make sure they are picking up the right thing. Again, since you’re dealing with Caviar and not the restaurant, you have no way to make sure that you actually get what you paid for. A credit is of no use when what you wanted was the food. 

Then, even if the order is correct, they don’t use insulated bags, so about 70% of the time, the hot items arrive cold and the cold items arrive warm. If it’s raining, the food arrives wet. 

Finally, their delivery estimates are understated about 80% of the time, usually in a big way.  Yes, you get update emails, but that doesn’t help when you relied on the time estimate in making your choice, and by then you’re money is gone and you can’t make another choice. 

They’re going to need to do something radical about quality control before I use this app again.

I saw 1 person in a car in front of my job but because they never got out of there car, rolled down there window, and the app doesn’t show you for some reason what the plate of the car or mode of transportation is for your carrier i assumed it wasn’t them. Eventually i see that the app says that’s food was delivered but again i never revived it.
I decided to go outside to see if i could catch the delivery person and coincidentally enough that same person in the car in front of my job now had fried in his hand and a shake shack bag in the passenger seat.

There were multiple occasions where my order got indefinitely delayed. I had to reach out to customer service via their chat option. The issue is always that there is no dasher to pick up my order. Caviar makes no effort to address this issue in the long run. The only forward is to contact customer service which is incredibly rude, unhelpful and slow. They accept no responsibility for the delay caused or that you had to go hungry for hours waiting for your food. They’ll offer a measly $5 credit and cancel the chat without even offering the courtesy of “is there anything else I can help you with?” They don’t even wait to ask if you want a refund or cancel your order.

Caviar and it’s customer service is unable to listen to customer feedback and repeated issues. They make no effort to improve or even try to help.

 I never order from Caviar if I want guaranteed delivery or want to make lunch during work because I know it will be late or never come.

The first one, I ordered a salad from a place about a mile from my house around 7:30pm. The restaurant closes at 9 so there was plenty of time to fulfill the order before close. Long story short, I waited 2 hours and never got my salad. The estimated delivery time kept getting pushed out. When it said 9:15, I thought the driver was picking up the order just before close and I’d still get it. Nope. I found myself at 9:45pm without food & with few options given other restaurants were closing. Luckily I had food at home. Caviar refunded my order and acted like that was a special favor they were doing for me but that’s just basic curiosity given I never got any food. When I pushed back, they gave me a $10 credit- not even enough for a meal. They didn’t even really apologize- very poor customer service.

The about a week later, and again tonight, my order took over 2 hours to deliver after multiple updates to the ETA. In both cases, I’d already made other food plans because I was hungry and not sure I’d ever get my order given the previous experience.

1,False,This app is undercooked,2020-02-23 18:41:48,"I really wanted to like Caviar because they have a great, and unique collection of restaurants. Sadly, however, I’m fresh off of my second poor experience using this app. 

To start, it’s hard to get accurate updates on what’s happening with your order because the app time stamps mean virtually nothing and the GPS function doesn’t really appear to move with your courier. I’ve had food come up to an hour later than the estimated delivery time— and of course it was cold by then. 

This time, my delivery time continued to be delayed and I also wasn’t able to connect with my server by phone for an update. A mix up in contact information (that I did not provide) meant someone else almost received my food. 

Frustrated by this and not knowing what was happening with my order, I contacted customer service. As I’m opening the chat my order arrives with a very confused courier. I let the customer service rep know my food had arrived and that seemed to sum up the issue for her... nevermind that everything leading up to that went haywire. I appreciate that she was polite but poor service is still poor service and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

I just don’t want anyone else to have to deal with the level of ineptitude or dishonesty that typifies the Caviar experience as I’ve had it. They promise you delivery times that are routinely wrong by multiples not percentages. For instance an order that they say will take 30 minutes will take 90 minutes (3X).  To make matters worse they send you updates that promise delivery in say “around 5 minutes” and then update that several times so it ends up being 35 minutes. Once the food finally arrives it’s often inedible owing to the length of time the delivery has taken. At this point I would question the credibility of any restaurant that would employ this app. The food delivery business is becoming increasingly crowded and choosing a credible delivery service should be a reflection on the place that chooses it.

- They charged for the order (hit my credit card) but never put the order through to the restaurant. I called the restaurant after one hour with no food at my door and they never received my order.

- They don’t have customer service to help you through mishaps like the above. The restaurant blames Caviar and asks you to call Caviar while Caviar does not have a customer service number you can call. 

- They have black out times they don’t deliver for a restaurant, even when the restaurant is open. If you call the restaurant, they’ll say they’re open and Caviar can deliver, but on Caviar they’ll block you from ordering from the restaurant.

You can no longer tell whether restaurants are out of your delivery area or just not open.
I should not have to pay for missing items (which have both happened on the last two orders I made!) but it’s like pulling teeth to get this to happen, and the app makes it impossible to say that more than one thing is missing. Which it frequently is. 

Since they switched to Door Dash, in over half of the last updates, the notifications haven’t worked. And since drivers have stopped texting or ringing your doorbell, my last three orders have gotten cold. The one before that, the driver delivered my food to the wrong house, and when he finally delivered to my house, he felt the need to stand on my doorstep and make phone calls to god knows who, which is really weird.

1,False,Worst customer service of any company I have ever dealt with,2019-07-01 02:30:49,"Twice in a row, Caviar failed to deliver my food. Earlier this week, they delivered an order without the main dish in it. Not quite sure how that happens. By the time they responded, the restaurant was closed. They provided a refund and a credit of 10 dollars. So I ordered again tonight. 

Placed my order at 845. Said it would be here at 930. By 945 it had not arrived so I went to the app, which said it had been delivered.

Then I saw Caviar had emailed me saying the order was lost because the delivery guy was in an accident. I’m hoping they are ok but when I tried to figure out what to do it got totally out of control. 

The email asked if I wanted a refund or redelivery. When I responded asking them to contact me I got no response. They sent this in an email, mind you. (Who uses email to communicate in time sensitive situations?? Seamless calls and texts when there are delays)

By this point, the restaurant’s kitchen was closed. I couldn’t find a phone number for them. Sent three emails that i have not received a response for. And then got a “live chat” representative who responded by text but took up to five mins between responses and didn’t actually read my descriptions. It took me 15 mins to confirm a refund with them.

Within the minute of my text, I get a response saying this Caviar rep will attempt to call the restaurant and see if they can redeliver. I go on a rant about how terrible this experience is. 12 minutes later, she asks if I want a refund or her to call the restaurant to redeliver. 

What was she doing this whole time??? The entire customer support process took about 20 min total without the added wait time for the new delivery.

DELIVERY:
First of all, I’ve had MANY TIMES where I ordered food with a group of people (or just by myself), and had the order either cancelled an hour or two later with no warning, delivered late, delivered with missing items or not delivered at all (even though they claim that it is delivered). I don’t understand how a company like caviar could still be fully functioning when their service isn’t unique at ALL, nor is their service good. UberEats and DoorDash do a better job without any of the headache. They actually take accountability.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT:
On top of the awful delivery service, the customer support is the WORST!! They take forever to respond to you! There is no live chat to talk with support about missing orders or anything. Don’t expect to get a response from them until 30 minutes AFTER you sent an email about your email. There is probably just like 5 people working in the office to deal with HUNDREDS of complaints. They DEFINITELY don’t put the customers in mind.

When going back to report this, the app apparently only lets you choose one issue to report per order. It didn’t let me choose the option of a no-show.

So we walked out and walked to that restaurant to track it down. Only After that, I got a text from the courier asking where I was. So we walked back (a block) and once again, no one was around. The end state with Caviar is that you don’t get your food, the courier gets to walk off with your food (nice meal for hiM that I paid for), and you don’t get a refund.

1,False,Bad Customer Service,2020-06-01 22:38:10,"So it’s hard to top DoorDash for being terrible but Caviar takes the cake. I placed an order and then had it abruptly canceled without explanation when I was expecting the order to show up.

Customer service told me the cancelation was because the restaurant was closed on an “emergency basis” and that the restaurant should have informed them so they could limit the ability to place orders in the app. This didn’t sound right to me, so I checked the restaurant’s actual website. Lo and behold, they’re always closed on this specific day of the week, so not only did Caviar screw up, customer service lied on top of it. I would have been fine with a simple “Sorry, we screwed up” but this was kind of ridiculous. There’s not really much excuse for lying and throwing the restaurant under the bus over a relatively minor (albeit annoying) issue.

That being said, I’ve had enough with these tech solutions bleeding both restaurants and customers for fees and being as terrible as they are. Save yourself the trouble and call the restaurant directly to place the order (even if you have to pick it up yourself). It’s not that inconvenient, and most restaurants will thrown in a thank you for taking the time to help them out.

1,False,Don’t trust the estimates,2019-06-02 20:38:21,"Caviar offers a compelling app experience that entices you to order and discover new foods. The service works great when everything is perfect. Unfortunately, there are too many external factors that bring the experience to an infuriating place.

The app estimates the range of time it will take to fulfill your order. The estimates are not to be trusted. Once you place the order, after waiting for a certain amount of time the app notifies you that there’s an issue and the new estimate is later than original. This repeats itself 2-4 more times until you finally get your food 1-2 hours after originally anticipated. Why? The issue typically lies in the delivery agents who will sometimes accept and then cancel your food. They also have to deal with volume of orders, traffic, and miscellaneous aspects.

What about Takeout? Just call the restaurant directly. Caviar adds in additional buffer for the pickup estimates and once you end up at the restaurant, the food has actually been ready for 20-30 minutes - meaning you’ll have cold food. Restaurant owners have told me to just call them directly instead of using Caviar or Eat24. It really does make a difference.

Plus, it took over two weeks for me to receive a refund and I had to follow up multiple times.

I decided to give them another try in case my first situation was just a fluke. It was not a fluke. Caviar is consistently the worst delivery app. I waited over 2 hours for my food to arrive only for them to cancel my order two hours later.

During this time (around 9pm) my courier called me to say that Caviar should have informed me that my order had been cancelled but they never did. He said to contact customer support.

It’s been hit or miss once I talk to customer service. They eventually “solve” my problem, but it’s usually a refund or a new order and I've waited 2 hours for my food. No thanks. I’ve only used it because of 2 restaurants not offers on any other app. So unfortunate.

1,False,The delivery is garbage/ customer service is worst,2017-11-20 05:50:33,"Caviar should be ashamed of themselves.

This is all within seriously ten minutes, so the delivery person could just easily come back. Then this is where it gets weird, the customer service starts blaming us. Saying that the driver saw me from afar, but was confused. What? What? I don’t even understand how they could make this so complicated.

The restaurant gave us a number for caviar and said to ask to resubmit to get our food but the number is just an automated machine that hangs up.

I had to download caviar for a local restaurant I liked to accept take out order. After trying it out as a delivery service, I am appalled at their shortcomings. 

My last three consecutive meals delivered incorrectly: first was missing the main course. Second was cancelled about an hour after order placed because the restaurant apparently closed. Third meal had carrots in the box instead of cheesecake. 

What is going on over there?

Costumer service in-app is useless. Each time I reached out to the help chat, I didn’t get a response until HOURS later. I’m talking reporting a problem at 7pm and hearing back at 11:30pm. It’s wild. No accountability. Again, I have 0 confidence in their ability to carry out orders correct now.

I repeat — do not use this app. 

Just some of the many issues that other reviewers have noted:

1. Food orders are ALMOST ALWAYS delayed. Caviar will give you an “estimate” once you order, but will constantly move the estimate times. At one instance, I received my order more than two hours later. 

2. Even with significant delays, Caviar will never refund your order, even if your food comes two hours after you order it. You’ll get your food bland and cold, and an apology “5 dollar credit” that can only be used on Caviar (Caviar: why would I want to use the app again, given my awful experiences on it?) 

3. Orders are oftentimes damaged. The drink in my last order exploded, rendering the food uneatable. The courier said that Caviar did not tell him that there was a drink included. Instead of just refunding the whole order, customer service had the audacity to ask which items were “undamaged,” suggesting that they were trying to skirt the refund.

So, I get the notification that my courier has picked up my food after I ended the chat. There is no gps tracking on the guy because his is “broken.” Out of curiosity I check back and his dot has appeared (perhaps, mistakenly) and I can see how he’s clearly taking a circuitous route to me by dropping off at locations all around my neighborhood.

I had ordered sushi delivery on Wednesday, to arrive Friday at 6:45. The window of deliver allowed the food to arrive 6:15 at the earliest.

The customer “support” (I spoke with Zen and Jaja) was absolute horrendous. They kept giving vague unhelpful replies and then immediately disconnecting before I could reply.

Super inaccurate delivery time estimates.  Estimated 1:19-1:30 but came at 2:10. And the food was completely destroyed.  Delivery dude just smiled and left.

Caviar: the solution is certainly not to make your customers do more work by contacting you yet again.

The costumer service person was very accommodating and helpful, however the food didn’t arrive until 10:40 pm!!!!! I was told the courier was on his way to the wrong address. This sounds like a complete lie. When the Courier arrived he didn’t even apologize for the delay and when I asked why the 45 minute delay politely, my questions weren’t even acknowledged.

I like the look and the app environment, however delivery gets a -10 due to this issue. For an app who’s primary goal is to deliver food, it seems they can’t do it properly.

Over half the times we’ve ordered through Caviar, there has been a serious problem with our delivery. Of our last 3 orders, two have arrived nearly an hour late. One order was not only late but ENTIRELY wrong (it literally had someone else’s name on it). 

To make matters worse, there is no way to contact Caviar by phone, so you’re at the mercy of their text-based customer support.  When an order is wrong and a restaurant is closing soon, this lack of phone support can mean the difference between a hot meal and no meal at all. 

In many of these instances we have had to fight tooth and nail to get even a partial refund (Caviar tends to offer a $5 credit, which doesn’t even cover the service fee). 

I keep giving Caviar another chance, but after another mishap tonight, I’m finally ready to uninstall.

You’ll have to call and explain and pray that they haven’t started making your food only to throw it out or let it sit there for hours. Do not bother contacting caviar customer service to resolve any of this, or to help with the status of a late delivery - they don’t know what’s going on with your order and they clearly do not care.",Nmar9475,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

HOWEVER, now they will use UI/UX tricks like pop-up ads claiming ""free delivery"" for certain restaurants and days, but when you go to check out (yes i made sure the price was above $25 and met all requirements) the delivery fee was blatantly there and not removed..

The automated customer help prompts resulted in a message saying “sorry for your inconvenience but we can’t issue a refund” and contacting a real human was a 45 minute waste of time.

I attempted to place an order and the app told me I was out of the delivery radius.  Just for fun I looked up the route on Google Maps and it’s 5.8 miles, within the radius promised the restaurant.

Since then I have had numerous emails back and forth with Caviar, most stating that my address is not in Portland and therefore not deliverable regardless of distance.  I sent an email with photos of current mail showing my Portland address.  They then promised escalation to someone who would get back to me with results.  Crickets.

Customer rep comes on and says it’s all good now, courier is on its way.  Good to check 15 minutes later and order is cancelled - no notification or anything else. 

Unhappy about this experience and go to ask what happened, rep tells me the restaurant stopped taking orders a few weeks ago and then closes the chat session as resolved. 

Basically one customer support rep lied or was completely incompetent, next one did an equivalent of hanging up.  Then a third says they will look into it and then closes the case.

1,True,Like Food Russian Roulette,2019-07-15 00:30:03,"Review based on probably 100 Caviar orders in NYC over the last couple years...

Ordering from Caviar is like Russian roulette, you will never know with complete certainty what will happen, but you have a 1 in 6 chance of it being really terrible. 

More often than not deliveries are late (to the developers: your batching system is a joke). 

Every once in awhile you’ll have a delivery guy string you along for a solid hour to two before cancelling outright. Customer service is polite but hapless at the end of the day. 

I haven’t had a home cooked meal in about two years, but even with my desire to never cook and Caviar’s great selection of restaurants, I can say unequivocally that I won’t be using them unless I feel like not eating.",IMGC,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,"{'id': 7762768, 'body': ""Thanks for the feedback and I'm so sorry to hear about the issue you've experienced.

There have been countless late nights where I’ve ordered something on Caviar, and after waiting for 45 minutes, I’ll get a notification that my order has been canceled because the restaurant that I was ordering from is no longer available. It would be extremely helpful to have each restaurant’s hours posted somewhere that is easily seen by users. Also, this app is almost unusable after 10:30pm because almost all the restaurants are no longer available even when they haven’t actually closed yet and I can still order from them using other apps such as UberEats. Another small gripe is that the delivery time estimator is extremely off. Delivery times for each restaurant are usually at least 10 minutes underestimated and even after ordering delivery times change drastically, from 25-35 minutes to 45-55 minutes. Once the order has been picked up, it hilariously overestimates the time it will take to get to my location, often claiming that a two block distance will take 8 minutes to traverse. Not the biggest deal, I admit, but it can definitely be confusing when you first download the app. However, my overall Caviar experience has been a positive one and I truly appreciate the high quality of the restaurants provided. Keep up the good work and hopefully you guys will have some time to make these small changes that will have a huge effect on your users’ experiences.",Heracthijbgr,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

5,False,We love Caviar!,2019-12-03 00:39:50,Excellent service and great choices!,@larryb,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
4,False,"Yeah, Alright",2017-11-10 20:37:13,"I can get on board with this with app! I was definitely skeptical (and quite peeved) after my very first order when my order was randomly canceled, 20 minutes after placing the order. Trying to give Caviar the benefit of the doubt and chalking it up to the restaurant, I ordered again (different place this time). Muuchhh much better! Like Uber eats, they show you the progress of your order on a little time line and they give you a time estimation to when it will be delivered. Unlike Uber eats, the courier was top notch and braved the ridiculousness that is my apartment building’s stupid layout and came straight to my actual door! He was so nice and patient as I gave him instructions on how to navigate the building, insisting for me to stay put and that he’ll find his way to me. The food was delivered 10 minutes earlier than the estimated arrival time and I am such a happy camper, writing this just after finishing my delivered meal. Caviar immediately refunded me the money from the canceled order and all is right with the world. 

Before this, I was a somewhat avid user of Uber Eats, and as much as I liked watching the little car on my phone drive up to my house, I have repeatedly had items missing from my orders and seldom had the drivers make it to front door of my building. I get they’re on a schedule or whatever but it’s no fun running out to the car in the rain in my pajamas. Also, they were noticeable more pricey with their tax and delivery fees. There are still taxes and a small courier fee but it’s still cheaper than Uber eats. I’ve also tried Eat24 (Yelp’s food delivery app) and I LOVE how you can see the ratings for each place, giving you an idea of the food quality, vs. simply going off the pictures. That would be my only suggestion to Caviar.

I’m doing my best to support local restaurants during COVID and that usually means ordering through these types of apps but tonight was a travesty. I ordered dinner at 7:30PM with a 30-50 min delivery window. I wasn’t in a rush but when an hour passsed, I requested a status update and received a “sorry it’ll be a little longer...” message. Not a problem. At 1.5 hours I tried to cancel, but you can only do that through the chat which is unavailable due to COVID, so you’re rerouted to an email. This is understandable, however, most food apps have an option to cancel and select reason in the app setting or below the receipt. Why Caviar doesn’t have this feature, is beyond me. It is now 10:15PM and the delivery time just keeps climbing. The place is clearly closed or too busy, but I have received no such update. Which again, most apps let the restaurant itself reject your order when they become too busy.
When I tried to contact the restaurant to cancel , there was no number listed in the details. Shocking! This May be to prevent people from hounding the shops about their orders but circumstances like these are why it’s necessary. 
My other issue with Caviar is that there is no way to contact the delivery person. Once after ordering, I noticed my delivery time had passed. When I checked the map, I saw that the delivery driver had been driving in the opposite direction from my house for nearly 15 min. When I tried to contact them no contact information was provided and I had to do it through chat- ridiculous! Just a quick call/text “hey! you’re going the wrong way” would have fixed it, but instead I had to waste another 10 min chatting to a person in order to contact the driver to tell them they’re going the wrong way. Absolutely ludicrous. My food, was of course, ice cold when I received it. No refund. 
This is no way to run an app. Digital savvy will never replace the need for good customer service. I think I’ll just order by phone from “only on Caviar” restaurants until they can sort themselves out.",jordania shiri,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

They’ve delivered to us many times in the past and our address is posted on the curb as well as on the house. Anyone with a GPS would have no problem finding our house. 

We texted him back explaining to him our location and didn’t hear back from him for 37 minutes. The second text we received from our driver said that the order was canceled. The third text we received said the order was delivered! We texted him saying that the order wasn’t delivered to us and his reply was to tell us that our money wouldn’t be returned and to contact Caviar if we had any problems. 

IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT CAVIAR!! They don’t return emails and their phone number has a recording saying something like, “we don’t except international calls”. They’re in San Francisco and we were calling from Los Angeles! The only link we had to the company was our drivers phone number and he wouldn’t return our texts. Probably too busy eating our food. 

Anyway, now we have to waste time contacting our credit card company as well as filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (where we viewed many complaints against them) and lastly we of course went hungry.

1,False,Ridiculous Customer Experience,2020-02-18 06:44:55,"I tried Caviar’s service the first time and it is the worst experience ever. Why did not I just use Postmates or Ubereats? So this bad experience started when the driver contacted my saying he could not find the address and entrance. Then he said he is at another gate and asked me to walk over there. I searched on map the location he said but it is not on the map. Then I told him to come back to the address I put and he can see me standing in the cold wind waiting for him. I was worrying about the 10 minutes forfeit rule so I asked him to come back to the original gate quickly. He finally agreed to come over and he saw me. He is waiting to make the turn and then give me the food. But ironically the next minute he went to another direction and never came back. I did not receive any call or text for explanation and I do not know what happened to my food. I was already waiting in the wind for 15 minutes. In the mean time, I received an email saying that my order was delivered. You must be kidding me. I saw that men leaving in his car with my food. He is not even responding to my calls. Just because the driver spent too much time on communicating where we should meet, 10 minutes passed and he wanted to move on the next order. But why did the driver respond to Caviar that my order is delivered? This 10 mins rule is ridiculous and it is favored towards driver because they can simply waste time on calling and negotiating with diner, then he can take the food away! The app or platform is seducing drivers to steal your food!!! What’s even worse is that you waste your time, standing in the wind in a winter night and waiting for your food for 20 minutes. Even though this is my first time trying this app, I will never use it again and for sure not recommending to any friends. I would warn them how bad this platform is.",CelineLi8221533,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

1,False,DO NOT USE THIS IN NYC AREA,2019-11-16 18:44:37,"I used to be a long time customer in NYC area for caviar every since it started and it did provide a decent service up until this year. The past few months however I have experienced the worst service ever- first of all do not believe any estimated delivery time as my past 5 orders or more all took longer than 2 hours to deliver when the estimated delivery time said 40 min. I had to refund many times due to its incredible inaccuracy with delivery time. Customer service always says the same thing where they just give out a blanket statement apology and that they will be looking into to improve and blames the courier and restaurant when there is clearly an internal issue in how they assign the couriers or maybe just don’t have enough couriers compare to what they pretend to provide by their service information. For example one time my order from a specific restaurant took 2 hours and still not picked up, the caviar customer service blamed the restaurant for the delay and I cancelled the order and reorderd from the same place through ubereats and it came through within 40 min as it promised. If you don’t want to wait around for your food for more than 2 hours every time you order from any place including ones only few blocks away from you, please refrain from using this app. It’s sad to see a once good service completely deteriorate and lose its reliability to long time customers with deceiving delivery time. Also the customer seevice people tend to just cut you off while having conversation and just leave with a robo message sayinf “it seemslike  everything is clear!” As I am still typing my message- this happened to me 6 times in the past few weeks. Again, if you are in NYC area please DO NOT USE THIS APP. I recommend any other delivery apps as this one has deteriorated its service so much to obscurity- very disappointing how a once reliable app is now the least reliable service and yet still claims to be providing a high quality delivery service with tracking when in reality it is filled with deceiving information of constantly changing courier names and estimated delivery time on the tracker. Customer service people seem quick to cover up the truth as well as they always give a blanket statement of “the courier is on its way now.” And then taking another full hour until I reach out to them again which leads to them repeating the same message. All in all a very shady service at this point and I warn everyone in NYC area to stay away from this app. This is coming from someone who used this app for the past 2~3 years.",121212e,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

1,False,2.5 hour delivery time,2019-02-21 02:50:05,"This is my first and last time ordering food through this app. I frequently use food delivery apps (UberEATS, DoorDash, Grubhub, etc) and have never had an experience like this. I chose to use Caviar because I received a coupon for $10 off my order. I placed my order at 6:24 pm and did not receive my food until 9 pm. The original delivery time was 7:20. At about 7:15, I received notification that my order was delayed about 10 minutes. Then, shortly after, I got notification of another 10 minute delay. Then another. At that point, I spoke with the customer service chat who told me that the courier’s GPS was not working but that he was 10 minutes away. After another 20 minutes, I opened the chat again and they told me he had to “stop to refuel.” I then (after some searching) found their customer service number and they apologized and credited me $30 to my account (my order total was $42). 20 minutes after that, I received a call from the driver who proceeded to tell me that he “picked up too many orders and had to stop for gas,” but that he would be there in 10 minutes. Suffice it to say he was not. I called the restaurant who told me that the driver picked up the order at 6:40, meaning he had the food in his possession for 2 hours, despite the restaurant being 11 minutes away. Customer service tried to resolve the issue by crediting me the full amount, but I told them I would never be ordering from them again and that I want a credit to my card which they honored. I received my food cold and way past the time I normally eat dinner. From now on I will stick to my normal delivery apps regardless of receiving a coupon.",D.Ata17,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,"{'id': 7403420, 'body': ""Thanks for the feedback and I'm so sorry to hear about the issue you've experienced.

1,False,Door Dash Acquisition Failure,2020-11-01 22:26:41,"Ever since Caviar was acquired by Door Dash the service has declined significantly in two ways, the accuracy of orders and the customer service skills of the delivery personnel. Several of my recent orders have been missing items which door dash charges me for and will only issue a credit. The main issue with this is that the missing items are not on the receipt that the restaurant provides with the delivered order so it seems as if Door Dash is failing to communicate an accurate order to the restaurant but is still collecting the funds for entire order and doesn’t give an option to refund. As a result Door Dash is holding on to cash for services not provided, which is also floating funds of customers which is not a good business practice at all. 

Second the majority of the delivery people since the acquisition have lacked customer service skills. I have had delivery people tell me that issues with my order is not their fault, I have received food that is tipped over or cold, and there have been several instances where they cannot operate a call box, despite me putting specifics instructions in my profile letting them know all they have to do is dial 3 numbers and they will be buzzed in and can leave the food at the front desk. When they are unable to operate the call box they will call and sometimes yell at me that I need to come down and get it or they have left on the sidewalk in front of my building. Given the current conditions with respect to The Pandemic and the astronomical fees that door dash is now charging, this level of service is unacceptable. 

All of these aforementioned issues, including the fees charged were never issues prior to the Door Dash acquisition of Caviar. It is really too bad to see that Door Dash purchased such a great company and have so quickly turned it in to something that so low quality. I think this is especially distasteful given the pandemic and people’s inability to dine out. I hope the management team takes a look at their current practices and adjusts.",Pdxgreyfan,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

They said the driver had the food and was on the way. I told them I couldn’t see any progress in the app but if that was true it’s fine. 30 additional minutes later I asked if it was still coming and they said yes then I asked for an ETA and at this point the customer service agent completely stopped responding to me! I called the restaurant myself and they said the food had been sitting for nearly an hour and they called caviar (because restaurants and drivers can but not customers) and caviar told them to CANCEL MY ORDER without ever once telling me. Oh wait except 1 minute after that the driver calls and says he’s at the restaurant who is refusing to give him the food because caviar told them to cancel it despite not actually canceling the order since the driver could still see it? Was caviar just planning on keeping my money? The driver and restaurant worked with me and got me my food 2 hrs and 30 mins after the initial order but I will NEVER use caviar again.

I live in Los Angeles and had used them once months prior while I was in San Francisco. I spent the next hour trying to contact them to let them know. I tried securing my account by removing my credit card info and they wouldn’t allow it. I called the delivery address it was going to and told them to turn the driver away as I didn’t order anything. The driver then called me when he tried to deliver the food and I explained, again. The driver said he could not cancel the order. I told him again that I am not even in San Francisco and didn’t place this order. Then Caviar finally called me ( apparently they have real life employees, who knew!) and stated that the food was going to be dropped at the doorstep if they couldn’t get in the building. I then had to explain AGAIN that I never ordered to begin with. I finally was told thanks for letting us know, we deactivated you account. No apologies for all the inconvenience they caused whole I was at work. To to it off, I woke up this morning to an email that my credit card was charged. They still charged my card so now I will be spending more time on this crap disputing charges.

Forcing the customer to sit there and wait while it gets cold and lying about delivery time. What is the point of having a tracking device that lets users see the location of drivers, only to literally show them picking up other orders and waiting for ANOTHER order on top of yours, with your food? Restaurants are putting trust in caviar to deliver their food in a timely manner right after it’s picked up and instead they make the customer wait an entire hour so they can do multiple orders the entire time showing it on the screen where the driver is going. They drove right past my house, stopped somewhere a mile away for at least 20 minutes completing an entirely separate order, AFTER notifying me that the courier was arriving to my door. Why not just be upfront to begin with about how long it will take and that a driver may be completing a separate order at the same time?  Its dishonest, money hungry, horrible customer service, creating a bad experience for the CUSTOMER AND THE RESTAURANT AND THE DRIVER. All to what, save a little bit of gas?

I arrive late at 5:20 and the guy working is confused about my order and said it was for later, then checks the ticket and realizes that he had the time wrong in his head. He tells me it’ll be 15 minutes and I said that I couldn’t wait because I had to be at the party that I’m hosting and still had one quick stop to make. He seemed like he didn’t care at all and said very nonchalantly to cancel the order. Well, I couldn’t because I’d placed it several hours earlier. 

I send a message to the app but didn’t expect an immediate response. I get one hours later. They tried to contact the restaurant but couldn’t get through and told me there was nothing that they could do because it was a pick up order (whatever that is because Uber Eats and DoorDash are always helpful). They told me to call the restaurant and discuss refund with them. Just called the restaurant and spoke to the manager and he said to call Caviar. This is ridiculous. I told him that Caviar told me to call them, so he said to call back tomorrow (January 7th) after he speaks to another manager about what to do. Needless to say, I’m not ordering with Caviar again.

1,False,Terrible Experience,2018-04-27 23:18:11,"Customer service could NOT have been more unhelpful. Their conduct was unacceptable due to their rude demeanor. I have NEVER had customer service argue with me before and this was the first time. I ordered 4 sandwiches at around 10:25am scheduled for estimated delivery at 11:44am. I was in the hospital and could not leave my post for long so I decided to leave 10 minutes before 11:44am to receive my food. The front desk staff told me that they had come 5 minutes ago when I showed up at 11:35am and don’t know where the driver went. The driver presumeably left the drop off point IMMEDIATELY after finding out I wasn’t there. According to your policy, they need to spend 10 minutes looking for you before they leave. They left immediately. Here’s a tip for your app. If you STATE on your app that the estimated time of arrival is a certain time, your driver should STAY there because your customer is EXPECTING it to arrive in tbe ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL. Not only that but I was not contacted once! And even worse, I was not able to call the driver on the app! It should be noted I checked the app constantly for updates... it went from estimated 20 minutes arrival to... oops your food is forfeited, you’re out 40 bucks and food oh well! How infuriating is that... that’s was th WORST experience I’ve ever had for any delivery service. And the customer service deciding to argue with me was worse. I almost did not get a refund! Completely unacceptable. I immediately resorted to DoorDash. A very reliable app that tells me exactly where my food was. I  was able to contact the driver to  ensure They knew  where I was going to be and the pick up was seamless. Excellent customer service and you should consider modeling after them if you are going to be taken serious as a business. Overall 1/10 app organization and 0/10 customer service.

1,False,DoorDash Ruined This App,2020-11-05 21:34:20,"Ever since the DoorDash merger (and in particular, ever since Caviar moved to using the DoorDash system and interface) this app has gone totally downhill. Caviar was once my app of choice, in large part because it had an exclusive and *limited* set of restaurants. Now, it appears Caviar has decided to move away from quality and towards quantity, and demonstrated by the flood of ghost kitchens and hole in the walls that were a rarity once upon a time. Moreover, like DoorDash, Caviar is totally non-transparent about which restaurants are real restaurants. Since the merger, the “Dashers” used by the app have been slower and less careful about quality than ever before, and whereas Caviar used to be very transparent about long wait times (including highlighting these long waits in RED), it’s not uncommon for Caviar to arbitrarily increase your maximum delivery time AFTER placing your order. In fact, I’ve been assigned drivers in completely different cities, on multiple occasions. Customer service, like DoorDash’s is god awful, as there’s no option to speak to a human being on the phone. Instead, you’re at the whim of chatting with what I can only assume are robots who’s only objective is to get to the next problem ASAP. Often I’ll have to deal with 2-4 agents for a single issue because of their agent’s tendency to end chats before actually confirming with the customer whether the issue is resolved. The only reason I still use this app is because Caviar still has a monopoly on restaurants that people would actually dine at in person. But truthfully, if I know a restaurant is on UberEats or Postmates I’ll make that order there. Lower service fees. Better customer support. Options to expedite ones delivery.

1,False,horrible customer service,2018-11-17 01:41:32,"Ordered a thin crust 28” pizza from Pizzeria Verti at 2:40pm. Expected delivery (high end)on app was 3:25pm.  I called the pizzeria at 3:30pm inquiring if the pizza has been made because the Caviar app indicated that it was still being prepared. The pizzeria said my order has been sitting up front for “awhile” and they’ve been waiting for the Caviar deliverer.  I then contacted Caviar customer service (request order status update) and email reply was “Thank you for contacting Caviar. We have received your request and are working on responding to you as soon as possible.”  At 3:37pm i get an email response “Your Caviar order from Pizzeria Vetri - Art Museum is on its way. Keep your phone handy in case the courier needs to contact you. We’ll see you soon!”  I check the app and the update said a driver was “on their way” to pick-up the order from the restaurant (10min past the expected delivery time) and it will be delivered at 4:06pm.  When my $43 order (over $10 of which was service and delivery fee) finally arrived, at 4:05pm, the pizza was cold and soggy. I again contacted customer service asking for a refund or some compensation for my order being delivered 40 minutes late and cold.  I have received NO response from customer service!!!! Also of note: weather and traffic conditions were fine.
The pizzeria is not at fault as the order had been ready.  The weak link is Caviar.

1,False,Terrible service - is zero stars an option?,2020-04-20 04:47:49,"I have been corresponding back and forth for two days now with customer service (after FINALLY being able to reach - there’s no direct contact info in the app and it sends you to a chat that only will give a canned response).

I tried the service once months ago and had an issue with my order which they provided a credit for free delivery to try again. They happen to have a restaurant I’ve been keep yo try that I’m slightly outside the restaurants direct delivery zone for.

Long story short, 45 minutes after when my order was to arrive I received a phone call from the restaurant that my order had been ready for 30+ minutes but no courier had been provided. They’d also been trying to reach Caviar to resolve but they were unresponsive. When I hit the status update request in the app they finally said “the restaurant had played my foot and they’re working to assign a courier”. After some back and forth with the restaurant since neither of us could reach caviar directly, a worker ending their shift kindly offered to deliver to me directly. While she took down my address apparently caviar doesn’t share contact info so it was left in my lobby with no identifying information. Not normally an issue, however I specifically order out and requested a contactless delivery given covid concerns. By the time I tracked down my order it was now nearly 2.5 hours after I had placed the order. Obviously the food was also completely cold at this point. I immediately went back to the app to flag and couldn’t do anything as it still was showing they were waiting to assign a courier.

I emailed the generic customer service email the canned response gave me only requesting a refund of the tip in the app (I tipped the person who dropped off directly - even more than originally planned because they went out of their way) and the service fee on my $50+ order. I’ve now finally received the tip refund but they are refusing to credit the service fee insisting it’s to cover their courier/support fees - which I continue to reiterate never occurred since there was no courier/support! My experience was basically if I had ordered via the restaurant directly and caviar did nothing but funnel the order then forget about it. They will only offer a $10 credit but given the hassle and poor customer service experienced in 2 of 3 orders I 100% do not intend to order through them again. Restaurants are already struggling and you’re passing the buck and letting them continue to take the hit.

I’d strongly suggest trying to order direct from a restaurant and if that falls through via Seamless/Grubhub/Postmates. All have considerably better and quicker customer service and delivery times and many of the same restaurant options.",Cook0315,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

1,False,Security issues and terrible customer support,2019-06-10 20:03:06,"Do not do business with this company. The app and the company won’t help you if you need it, there are serious privacy and security issues, and there is no way to contact a customer support number, only email- and only if your account is intact. Lack of integrity by the business support representatives. Not to mention high delivery and service fees.

I had unauthorized charges for a Caviar order on the card associated with my account. Immediately after the fraudulent charges, I received an email stating that the email address associated with my account had been changed, and that this was the last email I would receive from Caviar. It also stated that if I did not make this change, that I should contact their support center. 

There was no “click through” link to verify that I intended to change the email on my account. The hacker was simply able to do it without verifying through my email. This is a serious security concern that Caviar clearly does not take seriously. 

Regarding the “support center”, there is absolutely no phone number to call. The link for the “support center” is just a list of FAQ’s. And in order to email customer support you have to have an account. AND in order to chat with support you need to have made an order. So I literally had to create a new account just to email someone that could help. 

I emailed a representative who got back to me saying that he wasn’t able to help, and that the only thing I could do was dispute the charges with my bank. Extremely unhelpful and poor integrity practices as they knew my account was compromised, but were unwilling to refund my card. What is really concerning is that my account that was hacked and changed still has my card saved on it. They are completely unwilling to delete my card from their system, or cancel the fraudulent account. In face, they haven’t even responded to my email responses.

It failed six times in a row to be able to verify my Chase card at check out and I didn’t have another card to verify… I guess my billing address or whatever it’s verifying. I contacted support and after being on hold for 10 minutes, the best that support, which answered as DoorDash support, could do was just send me instructions for how to add a payment method to my account. And I was told that they can only send those instructions once I had gotten off the phone with them. Amazingly, the only way I was able to add and verify a payment method to my account was by putting in my PayPal key as a MasterCard to the app, and that apparently worked.

I gave up and ordered from Uber eats instead. 

This is the only food service app I have that needed it to verify my card by scanning it. This is it needed for Uber eats, doordash, GrubHub, seamless or anything else to my knowledge. End it failed remarkably at that.
And lastly, when I added my Chase card as a payment method I already had stuff in my cart and the message telling me that it didn’t work the first six times and then that it did work after that popped up underneath the view cart button. I literally couldn’t see what the message said except that I had seen that verification failure message in the same place before.

1,False,My order never arrived,2020-05-30 03:57:23,"I had never used Caviar before, but I had a $10 off promotion deal so I figured I’d give it a try. The tracking capabilities in the app, my order was prepared and picked up very quickly, but each time I went back to check on it, the estimated delivery time increased by minutes until the ETA became over an hour later than the original ETA. Looking at the map, the courier was clearly driving towards the opposite side of the city. When I called to ask what the status of the order delivery was, he said that when he arrived at the restaurant the order still wasn’t ready, and under the impression that Caviar would assign a new driver to deliver the food, he drove home.

After waiting another 10 minutes, it became clear that Caviar had not reassigned a new driver, so I reached out to Customer Service. They were able to refund my order but said the  order would no longer be delivered. This was a bummer, because it was now almost 11pm and very few restaurants were still open. Having already wasted my $10 off promo on an order I never received, I had no desire to order something from Caviar again, so I ordered from the same restaurant on Uber eats. This time, the order came within 20 minutes of placing it — clearly, the issue was not the restaurant itself, but of some sort of fault on Caviar’s end, whether with its communication with the restaurant or the driver.

Shortly after receiving my Uber eats order, I got a call from the restaurant, who realized that my name was on both of the orders. It was now 11:30 and they close at 11, and while the Uber eats driver had picked up my order, no one had come for the Caviar order still. I had to explain to the restaurant that Caviar was not going to send a driver for that order, so they should feel free to enjoy the food and apologized that they had stayed overtime waiting. I find this lack of communication with the restaurant to be completely unprofessional on Caviar’s part.

I do not plan to use Caviar again. Uber Eats is more reliable and has a greater variety of restaurant options. I hope my case was an isolated incident, because I found Caviar’s service to be unacceptable.",Zombiefarmer000,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
1,True,Great app until there is a delivery issue,2019-07-05 21:03:06,"July 1, 2019 Original Review: Easy to use, great app. I use it 10-12 times a month and have been doing so over 2.5 years. It improved significantly since I first started using it.

Great selection of restaurants but 20-30% more expensive then Doordash for the same order from the same restaurant. Having said that it has a far superior selection of high end restaurants.

HOWEVER, when things go wrong with the order that's when the entire experience goes pear shaped.

My orders got cancelled via caviar or the restaurant several times. The cancellations were generally 40-50 mins into ordering the food. I never got notified and got no explanation on why my order got cancelled. I noticed the cancellations when I checked the status of my order after an hour or so. I don't understand why caviar wouldn't send a text notification outlining the time and reason of the cancellation.

On a similar note when there is an involuntary cancelation, each time I contacted customer service I got a standard and very unsatisfactory response: you need to order again, wait another hour for the food to be delivered and here is your$10 coupon. Again I don't understand why Caviar can't generate an expedited delivery order automatically if the cancellation was due to a driver or restaurant error.

And what's up with the$10 coupon? If the family dinner ordered for 6pm is still not on the table by 8pm, and if each of our orders are around $100, what good it is to give a repeat customer $10 coupon. Terrible customer service idea implemented by incompetent customer service managers who clearly don't know and understand their target customer demographics. If $10 was important to us, I would have ordered from other cheaper delivery services. We are after convenience and good customer service that is delivered in a consistent manner. Unfortunately Caviar fails at this promise again and again.

July 5, 2019 CAVIAR Response: I got contacted by caviar yesterday regarding my review offering to help. Here is their response ( This is quite embarrassing and funny at the same time. After my rant about $10 coupons on this review, guess what they offered: a $10 COUPON). Here is their response:

"" Hi Hasan,
I'm so sorry to hear about your recent experience. We're constantly looking for ways of improving our delivery methods. Thank you so much for your patience as we perfect this process. We appreciate your ongoing loyalty to Caviar and have applied a credit for $10 towards a future order. 

This credit is available immediately that you can take advantage of and will expire after 30 days if unused. May we know on from what restaurant you had your order delayed?

I’m sure that we are not the perfect service but we will do what we can to improve in every way possible so that we can provide the best service as we can to our valued customers.

I’ve let it slide in the past, but told the restaurant that I didn’t want substitute cookies and had them removed. The employees said they would call Caviar to remove the charge.

I reached out to Caviar customer service three days later after noticing my account had not been credited. I was told to contact the restaurant. Had I ordered directly from the restaurant that would make sense. The app is supposed to provide convenience. I ordered via the app so the onus is on Caviar to handle issues with their vendor, even if the vendor forgot to call them. 

I called the restaurant and the manager was unaware that the “remove item - do not sub” option existed. The problem is inherent in the app and customer service policy is to pass the buck onto the customer to deal directly with the restaurant. 

On a positive note, the representative was polite and credited my account, along with a $10 credit after I called the restaurant so I gave them another chance.

I ordered a week later from another restaurant only to find out the place wasn’t open. Another issue — you shouldn’t be able to order from a place that isn’t open. I will not be wasting anymore time. Both restaurant managers said its easier to dial direct.

1,False,Do not waste your time!,2021-03-13 17:40:25,"Service: 
The last few times I’ve ordered food off this app, they claim 35-45 minutes, no big deal. What’s frustrating is that each time it has taken over two hours for me to receive my food. The food is cold, soggy and not enjoyable by the time it gets to me. Every time I’ve called support they have not offered a full refund but only the delivery fee which was $2.99 on $50+ orders. 

Dasher times:
I will get a notice that the restaurant is “preparing my food” then I’ll receive a “searching for dasher” notification to deliver my food all within 20-30 minutes. Outstanding! Swift and Easy! 
The downfall is it takes Caviar 90 minutes on average to find a dasher to deliver my food. So as I mentioned before, that 35-45 minute ETA turns into over 2 hours. 
If there is not enough volume of dashers or they have dashers that are just not accepting the order then you most likely shouldn’t have this app available. IT SHOULD NOT TAKE OVER TWO HOURS TO DELIVER FOOD 2 MILES AWAY. 

Dashers:
I live in a condo building in the heart of Philadelphia, understandable that dashers most likely cannot find parking or want to risk having the four ways on but i do not want to receive a phone call from the dasher telling me to meet him on the sidewalk to get my food. When the service claims “delivery at door” for covid procedures, I expect food at my door. Not me taking the elevator to the lobby and walking out to the street to meet them on the sidewalk. 

All of this has happened numerous times and enough is finally enough. I will be terminating my account with both Caviar and Doordash.",GiovanniLV,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

1,False,Customer Experience Is A Disaster,2019-09-27 02:07:04,"Ordered a gyro pita meal, came 40 minutes late after being picked up (driver literally stayed the same spot for 30 minutes the only moved when I first contacted support). 

I understand late deliveries happen once in a while (though not from the driver just sitting idly). The problem is that the oils and juices from the wrap made the pita bread mushy and un-eatable. The pita literally broke apart when I touched it, the vegetables were soggy. The food also was cold at this point to boot. At first the customer service agent tried to blame the restaurant for the bad food quality (wow, ok). It’s not the restaurant, it’s the delay in the delivery that caused the food to be soggy. 

At this point, you’d expect a refund for the order (even the customer service agent I got said so). But after an excruciating 20 min process of getting canned responses after canned responses, I was told that the company policy is never to issue refunds. She tried to give me in-app credit to match the order value ($60), but said after trying 7 times she couldn’t give me more than $20. 

This is an incredibly bad experience for customer retention. I am no longer using Caviar because of this awful customer experience and have told me friends to also uninstall. This is by far the worst delivery app I’ve ever had the displeasure of dealing with. 

That the policy is never to issue refunds means that at some point or another, when you have a bad customer experience (it’s inevitable), you will get screwed over. 

Caviar’s policies literally ensure you will always receive a poor experience because the system won’t even let the agent resolve the issue beyond a token, slap-in-the-face small credit for another order within 30 days.

1,False,Great with a sprinkling of awful,2020-08-29 00:01:57,"Great restaurants, and usually speedy delivery, but about 1 in 10 orders go horribly wrong, and caviar support is pretty bad.  So you have to plan on 10% of the time not getting your meal. (unless you’re willing to eat cold food 3 hours late.) 

Its weird- with other services your food might come 10-20 mins late, which is annoying, but its salvageable.  With caviar its either on time/early, or 2-3 hours late. It’s like if your order is going to be a little late, they just write you off.

First example: Ordered $150 of seafood (warm buttery lobster rolls, tuna crudo, French fries etc.)from my wife’s account. ETA 35 minutes.  At 50 mins Kept getting ‘something’s wrong with your order’ messages. Called the restaurant, they told us the food was prepared and sitting on the counter. Got new eta of 90 mins later. Tried to cancel, but couldn’t get any response from Caviar via the app, or website. Ended up having to order food from somewhere else, it arrived and we ate it before caviar arrived.  Everything was soggy and cold, (though to be fair the crudo was now warm) and inedible.  Caviar offered us a 15 dollar rebate (less than their service fee) on $150 of ruined food. Thanks guys.

Second example, just a few nights ago, ordered food with a deliver eta of 640pm. At 625 got told food was ready. At 640 got eta changed to 830.  Issues with the ‘courier network’ At least this time caviar let me cancel via service chat, but it took a while to do.

1,False,How Caviar got its Name,2020-02-15 01:44:04,"Being caught, sliced open and having eggs taken from your cold dead body is a pretty accurate description of what Caviar’s service is like...so I guess that’s where they got their name from. My main beef-a-roni is with their Customer Service. 

Other apps like Seamless correct their own mistakes (or even the restaurant’s mistakes) by offering you credit. But Caviar is holier than thou and makes no attempt to take responsibility for their service. What is their service? I don’t think they know but for the population who uses Food Delivery apps, we understand it as just plainly ordering food online.  Meaning, the concept of what they (should) do is provide a communication tool that reflects what their vendors/restaurants have on their menu so we can all be late-capitalists and order our food! 

But what if their descriptions aren’t accurate or imply something else? Well, that’s not chill and seems to be a huge flaw of this company’s main purpose. In my case, when something is labeled “add extra,” it implies that an order already comes with said item. Not for Caviar! Now I didn’t order McDonalds, but I do know when I order a 20 piece McNuggets...the badboys needa come with some extra BBQ Sauce and if you’re purist, Sweet and Sour. Everyone on the planet knows that the McNugs need that sauce! Some McDo’s give you you extra sauce for free, some don’t...but you have to ask for extra. Meaning, in addition to what you will be receiving. 

To Caviar, the concept of “extra” means nothing, I assume because to them (specifically my customer service rep David) words have no meaning or value. This is how Trump got elected...so, if you use Caviar you’re basically contributing to the downfall of the modern era.

1,True,Worst customer service EVER!!!,2019-10-24 22:53:22,"The fact that you have no phone line where I can speak with a human is disgusting and beyond a poor business tactic. I ordered food at 11:42pmwith expected delivery 12:36 - 12:46pm. The guy circled my block from 12:58 until after 1:10 and I called all he had to say was that he can’t get in and I reminded him that he should have read the description in my order instructions to use service entrance on 32nd street. The guy was beyond late as it was and then REFUSED to bring me my food!!! He then screened all my calls. I tried countless times on chats and email to get my problem resolved and no one contacted me!! I deserve a phone call as a customer who was not provided ANY service whatsover, let alone not even getting my food at all! AND they sent me emails saying my food was delivered when it clearly was not but no one would know that since they will not respond to call you back to countless chats and emails!

DO NOT GET THIS APP. Use literally any of the others because they will actually CALL YOU back or have a phone line in the first place!!!!

This is my first and very very likely last order with your app. How dare you not even have a call center for me to have this rectified!? I demand a full refund or will have my credit card company dispute the charge. I will consider my options with the Better Business Bureau based on how I was treared as a customer.

4,False,Decent service but very expensive,2017-04-07 16:06:14,"I use this app a lot because it has a great restaurant selection, and I consider myself a bit of a foodie. In my experience the time estimates they give for when the food will arrive are generally correct. Sometimes the food is only lukewarm by the time it arrives, but I sort of feel like that's the price you pay for ordering take out.
My main problem with the app is that the additional charges are very expensive. By the time you pay them, it's as expensive as eating at the restaurant. I'm always happy to tip my delivery person, but I like to know exactly how much I'm tipping. Caviar makes it unclear. There are three charges which come additionally to your food and tax: service charge (extremely overpriced and usually a surprise), delivery fee (at least they tell you this up front), and optional courier bonus. The problem is I have no idea how much to tip the courier because I have no idea what percentage he gets of the service and delivery fee. 
I will say that any time I decide to use an app other than caviar for take out, it is 100% because of the cost of the service fee. 
Other than that it's a decent app. They could improve some things, like search options and whatnot, but overall it's not bad. They're also very helpful if a restaurant is out of something you've ordered.

Also, I have clicked on the little hearts for some restaurants, indicating my preference for them, but I cannot find an area where I can call a list of those restaurants that I liked. 

On that note, since you do track our restaurant order histories already, having a restaurant page or card containing our order history just for that restaurant and maybe an area where we can jot down notes for ourselves to privately remember or perhaps an option to share notes a la Yelp for others to see and potentially benefit from (or like I mentioned previously just an API call to yelp or OpenTable or google to share more easily more info on the restaurant and benefit the restaurants more in so doing).

Otherwise this is my primary delivery app and has been for years, and that is for a reason.  Many things are simply done better or before the competition and the restaurant selection is better on selection (though not on time - must oder so early it feels like to me since SF itself is so early and the app has late night coverage gap for sure).

Crazy! Needless to say the pizza not only was stone cold but completely in edible and we just basically had to throw everything in the trash of course they absolutely refuse to give a refund of the $56 oh yeah that's the cost of one small pizza and a tiny salad when you get it delivered which I honestly don't mind paying if the food arrived at least half edible. After a horrible hostile exchange of emails with the completely inept customer service I called DelFina and spoke to reception they said they would look into the situation and have a manager call me back at least they were courteous and nice on the telephone unlike Caviar!

Contacted them through Text because they only had Email or Text customer service, which is STUPID, wasn't even able to talk to a real person. The person texted me back asking what was wrong, explained the whole situation, the customer service representative asked again what was wrong, explained AGAIN, then they replied they could only credit my account $5 bucks for the inconvenience, when I paid $40 bucks. Thanks Caviar. Thumbs down. Don't bother putting yourself through the trouble with them. If your order goes right, good, if not, there's no way they'd be able to help or fix it and you're just handing your money over to a dumb third party for no reason.

1,False,Fastbite delivery is very poor service,2016-02-09 19:29:55,"The basic Caviar service is fine.  The fees are much higher than what you would pay on Seamless, but they will deliver from restaurants that otherwise would not deliver so that's the trade-off.

However, the Fastbite delivery service is terrible.  Delivery men  never come to the right place.  On the occasions when they do, they refuse to just leave the delivery with the doorman (as every other delivery man does when dropping stuff off at my building).  They require you to come downstairs and go outside immediately while the delivery guy is standing there, rather than walking 10 feet to just give the delivery to the doorman (which would let him get to his next delivery much faster).  The food is also cold, and they do not give you a bag.

When I complained to Fastbite, they said their delivery standards actually are worse -- you could have to walk a block and go to the curb to pick up your lunch.  Forget it.  Maple, Seamless, etc., all have more options and deliver to your door--and will leave it with the doorman standing right there, which is more efficient for everyone.

Another shop I used to frequent made the switch and caviar handled the order so badly, I ended up waiting almost a full extra hour for some sides that caviar fails to list correctly for the merchants. It would have been faster if I ordered in person. Most of the shops I used order ahead on did not make the transfer over to caviar or any service, so I can barely use mobile ordering at all now.

One representative put me on hold and dropped the call, which wasted my time. Another person just hung up on me even before I say bye. The text service is pretty slow.

The restaurants included in the app are decent ones, but the food they send out is *sometimes subpar from what I believe they would serve in their establishments.

1,False,"Terrible Management, order accuracy, and support",2017-08-01 22:40:34,"I originally really liked Caviar. It came around before Uber Eats and Before Postmates became more food-centric.  However it was always plagued by problems and eventually I gave up on it.  That's because it got to the point where nearly EVERY order I placed was either undelivered for no reason or cancelled without even being informed.  Many times it would show an undelivered order was delivered!  I had enough.

Fast forward to today - about a year since I last ordered with Caviar. I was hoping it would have improved - yet - it got WORSE!

Another incorrect order came - except this time, I find out that they got rid of live phone support and I had to email my issue - waiting 30-45 min for a response!

This makes it IMPOSSIBLE to fix an order or have a missing item redelivered - essentially ruining your meal for the day.

With ALL the other food delivery services making it possible to reach out to them or the delivery person, Caviar - the most dysfunctional of all these - eliminates that option!

Personally, I don't see this company surviving past 2018.  It's great that they have pictures for mostly all items- and that's all that differentiates them - but outside of that, poor management, support, and order accuracy will soon put these people on the unemployment line.

1,False,Horrible!,2017-07-07 15:33:33,This recently replaced order ahead for my favorite coffee shop. You can no longer choose pick up time between the half hours. So. If you plan to arrive at a coffee shop at 815a your option is to either select 8a and have cold coffee or get stuck waiting until 830a. The second option totally defeats the purpose as you could live order in that amount of time.  Second the asap option changes between the start of entering your order and check out. For example -- this am it said my coffee was available for asap pick up in 10-15 mins. I completed my order in less than 30 seconds-- hit checkout my cart to which I discover the pick up time is now 40-45 minutes.  So basically this app defeats the intention we all appreciated with order ahead.  It's such a hassle that I either have cold coffee or have to cancel my order and live wait in line.

The only thing that could be better is if there was a service that could, with high confidence, deliver exactly what I wanted ready for me to eat exactly when I want it... all without me having to anything.

Yes I understand the service charges the tip in the delivery fee. If this is the only money the driver gets then sometimes I feel like the driver deserves more, with the gas prices and I the fact that I don't usually have cash on hand.

Other services such as Door Dash deliver food that has turned cold as if you are picking it up yourself and it took time to bring the food home.

One suggestion to Caviar is to have the feedback on service / restaurant built into text messaging reply functionality or to launch the feedback on a prior order when the app is opened the next time a customer wants to order something.

The app experience is the flat out worst of all 3. You're not able to track your food in real-time.  It's also the most expensive by far.  The prices of the food are more expensive than the menu price in the restaurant AND you have to pay for delivery.  I think one or the other is understandable, but both is borderline insanity.

I “spoke” virtually with Caviar customer service (there is no direct phone number to speak to someone) and they refunded me for the items not received, but refuse to refund me the full service fee they charged - even though that amount is a percent of the total order, and since they can’t communicate an order accurately to a restaurant, they shouldn’t still get a service fee (aka “tip”) for messing up my order.

1) Create the ability to add more than 1 payment method in account settings.
2) Cart interaction issues. We didn't figure out how to delete an item from the cart until we accidentally made the swipe gesture on the item.

Then there is the service itself. Over priced fees, no transparency as to what the driver receives, ridiculously long delivery times (truly absurd). The food is always cold on delivery, and somehow the drivers take circuitous routes that add time to the delivery (I watch in amazement on the app after the food is finally picked up, and I live in a ver accessible area of Turtle Creek).

However - being one person who doesn't eat a huge meal all the time, the minimum $$ amt. Needed to order from ALL places has caused me to avoid ordering for months now- since it began. Also- they never run any sort of promotion besides referrals which make sure your friend didn't once sign up (even if they never ordered !) because it has to be an UNREGISTERED email to actually claim the measly 5 bucks.

He left and I'm quite relieved that I did not have to face him in person. Of course I didn't get my order. Very unpleasant and scary experience.

The user interface is beautiful and the photos of all the dishes make choices much easier. However, the charges and delivery charges have crept up and now it is nearly as bad as just using postmates. In addition the menu item costs are inflated. Love the access to restaurants that don't deliver and the ease, but the creeping costs will make most orders pretty pricey.

2,False,Expensive and Quality Sacrifice,2017-06-27 18:15:06,"Decided to try the app platform with family in town. The experience was very fast considering the location and type of restaurant(s) the app offers. Unfortunately, we found that most discount codes we tried are not active even as a first timer. Additionally the service is expensive with multiple fees on top of the meal. Some required some optional (tipping). Everything would be worth it considering the service offered for prime food. But, we all noticed a significant issue with the quality compared to in restaurant. Although not fully Cavier's fault, the speed element which is forged with the restaurants seemed to sacrifice some noticeable quality and portion issues. We most-likely will not be using this service again as the cost-benefit is off.

Pros:
- Fast
Cons:
- quality
- price
- discount codes don't work",Apples2434,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

Their selection of food is great! Almost everything I ever wanted from SF restaurants.

Yes their delivery price is kinda expensive but I can live with that, labor isn't free.

The annoying quirks:
- many restaurants have weird delivery wait times, and caviar doesn't do a good job of telling me how to order, you gotta pick the exact hour. ""asap"" should just mean as quickly as you can, no-matter wait times.
- can't save multiple addresses for future use
- can't save multiple payment options

The UI and ordering experience is good. I presume this is because it was designed for mobile from the beginning, unlike some legacy web-based systems.

Caviar buried their feedback so it's much harder to ask for help when things don't go right. 
They have a nasty habit of inflating prices by promoting ""free delivery"" but adding dollars to dishes and separating out items that normally come together. Example: 

Panang curry from restaurant: $14 with rice

Same from Caviar: 
Panang = $16
+$3 (rice) 
+$1 (beef) 
+tax (untaxed at restaurant for hot food)
+$7 ""service fee""

20%!!!!!! ON TOP OF ANOTHER DELIVERY FEE!!!! THAT'S MORE THAN IF YOU WERE DINING IN PERSON!!! 

Are you kidding me, this is such a rip off and pisses me off to using their product.

Strictly as a design and usage UX for the consumer - Caviar is great. But it gets washed over by the prices.

5,False,The BEST!,2017-06-02 06:39:10,"Honestly, I don't get the negative reviews. I've been using Caviar for quite some time now and was a long-term customer of Postmates and Seamless in the past. I can confidently say from my experience Caviar is truly the best out of all three. I love the seamless quality of their app with photos and all. They collaborate with a certain collection of restaurants in NYC, unlike Postmates where it just gets diluted. In addition, Caviar does a good job by not overwhelming you with an extensive menu for each of their participating restaurants and in turn, which makes it easier to navigate and figure out quickly what you're in the mood to eat. My orders are ALWAYS fulfilled in a timely fashion, unlike Postmates where I'm waiting for the delivery to show up only to find out it has been canceled, or the restaurant is closed, or they don't have an item I've ordered. This has happened to me COUNTLESS times! Do you really want to wait another hour to start over on a new order with a different restaurant? I didn't think so. Caviar always arrives within 30 minutes or more, but I'm never stranded waiting for an hour or so. A gripe I have with Postmates is their delivery people always correspond back and forth with you via texts or calls. Honestly, I got no time for that. Caviar does an amazing job by fulfilling your order and delivering to your doorsteps, no correspondence needed. Last but not least, Caviar always notifies you every few days or so on its app of their free delivery charge using various promo codes. Gotta love that, saves me money.

5,False,It doesn't get better than this. All delivery services should learn from the Caviar model,2017-01-30 03:44:15,"I'll try to keep this as simple as possible. 

I've tried almost every delivery service available out there, I live in an area where almost all of them are available.  

1. Caviar isn't like some horrible DoorDash – that just rides on the delivery capabilities of other services or makes  excuses like DoorDash and Favor and Gribub does why they are always late.  

2.  Cavier is selective about the quaility of the restaurants they deliver from.   Truly  top notch and worth every penny. It's cheap compared to the amount of food, and the quality of food you're getting. 

3. Cavier's  websites description of the food, review of the food, is hundred percent ACCURATE  to what is actually delivered. I doubt that  other delivery services can say that.   not EVER  have I  found myself saying, what was delivered and what was described were two different things.  

4.  They either delivered  within the time that they predict or are even earlier. There's no runaround, there's no excuses, there's no""oh which building are you in?"" And there's No excuses, like  ""oh, what street are you on...."".  

I've never seen a service that met all the consumer requirements,  that was absolutely and fair in their price like the way Cavier is.  Their software is not confusing and based upon giving us  consumers every advantage including  requesting immediate updates.  

However - for  cheapskates  looking for any  pizza or sandwiches and they don't care as long as it fills their belly - yes they probably would be interested in other  services.",MrWinky,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

1,False,DO NOT GET. Worst delivery app.,2016-05-07 01:20:23,"I've used caviar for months because it has the best selection of restaurants out of all the delivery apps. However, it is awful. This time I've had enough and I am not going to use Caviar ever again. I ordered from Caviar for delivery at 5:30 PM and around 520 I noticed that the app said that the restaurant had not begun making my food yet. So I asked for a status update. The status update came in and said that someone would be picking up my food shortly and bringing it over. 530 came and went. 540 came and went. Around 550 I tried to request a status update, but I couldn't because the restaurant happened to have closed at 5:30. At this time I was worried that we would not be getting our food - I had ordered for a large group of friends who were over, and everyone was really hungry. When I finally got through to caviar support, which is the worst ever....(you have to fill out a longform and email them or you have to dial a toll-free number and be put on hold forever… and While I was on hold with the toll-free number I managed to fill out the form and write an email… If that gives you an idea of how long this takes) I found out that Apparently no one went to pick up my food and there's nothing they can do about it since Rushab was closed. The lady on the phone and said she could give me a $20 credit. my order was well over $200. $20 for completely missing dinner and no apologies?! I would take another hour and a half AT LEAST to get food. There was nothing else they can do, and there was no sense of urgency around trying to fix my problem. Then when I went to the app - apparently they had closed delivery in my area because of a Giants game. No one told me this on the pone. Well, that's one thing Uber has over caviar - excellent customer service. Needless to say I won't be going back to caviar. This is just one of many many similar instances of had with this company over last few months. Don't do it guys. Just order Uber eats.",RisingStar2011,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

This past New Years the mobile app kept stalling, asking me to revise order, asking me to update card and input the same security code multiple times and I was double charged and received 2 orders. 

This was not a small order this was a large order from a very nice restaurant. The app kept stalling and showing no delivery in progress then put another order through I’m guessing while I was trying to complete my order. When I received my very large family size order and then 20 minutes there was a knock at the door for the same food I was horrified but thought surely Xavier would straighten out the problem since it was obvious no one would make 2 orders of such a already large and generous order. 

Well I contacted caviar to a disappointing dismissive representative who sent me a reply email that it was a double order and  that they wouldn’t be looking into it further. 

I deleted the app and have reinstalled it for one meal and this review and am immediately deleting it.

I like caviar a lot, though imperfect, because it still was convenient, aesthetically pleasing, and pretty accurate! I almost always got my orders on time and without problems, and when drivers had problems, they contacted me for more information. 

So that’s my issue with the new ads for becoming a dasher and getting faster delivery times: I have never received an order from door dash without significant issues. It has also been nearly impossible to contact door dash / the deliverer after the delivery has been made (whether made or not). 

I would very much prefer accuracy and customer service over speed, and would prefer that those delivering food are paid their worth and treated with respect. (This has been a problem in the last re “dashers” speeding through orders at the speed of light so they get paid.)

Also, miss being able to enter discount codes BEFORE checkout. This was a great motivator to actually use codes and an easy way to keep track of them. The app even said when the code would expire!

Restaurants barely make anything- if they make $7-20 on that $70 order they’re doing well.

I went in today because the app advertised to waive the delivery fee due to the presidential debate this evening. The delivery fee is only three dollars for the restaurant I like.

Caviar needs to take a look at the better food deliver apps like Seamless, Grubhub, and Eat24",Likes a deal,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
2,False,EXPENSIVE: Service Fee & Delivery Charge,2016-01-29 05:12:02,App is nice. I like the pictures and it's easy to use but the service is rather expensive compared to its competitors. It's almost $10.00 just for the fees. I think double charging is a bit much.,ALL ARE TAKEN,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
1,False,ZERO customer support,2016-01-17 07:04:07,"This company does nothing to support their customers. Orders can arrive late and incorrect and then they at best offer an in-app credit for the order amount or if they ""break the rules"" they offer a refund. No effort to have the still opened restaurant remake the order. No token credit towards next order. Not even a promo code for a discount towards next order. Pathetic customer service.",Piemaman,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
1,False,Useless,2016-01-07 02:15:32,"75%+ of the restaurants are in seamless with no delivery fee, why use this app for a price to only get a limited menu?
Plus, the ones not on seamless, you can call and they usually deliver for free anyway - remember when we used to use our phones as phones? Try it and you'll save $4.99-$10.99 per order. Crazy, right?!?",CharlieEP3,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,

I received an email asking me to tweet @trycaviarsf my fave restaurant that wasn't on the app, and they added it within a week (for local delivery 😊)!! Caviar also has more reasonable delivery fees than other food delivery apps I've used. Netflix nights just got more awesome! 💻",dmoney12789,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
2,False,Not sure what happened,2015-11-07 03:35:40,I started using caviar because traditional delivery is ridiculous in SF - $20 min and 60 mins for delivery. caviar used to be great. Super fast and better restaurant options. Now all of a sudden it is slower than grubhub and eat24. I ordered from a restaurant 10 minutes away from my house (yes I am that lazy) that I always order from and it takes 20-30 mins - now the estimated delivery time is 100-120 mins. Ridic! Going to use postmates from now on.,Nycgirl10065,caviar-order-food-delivery,931355786,
