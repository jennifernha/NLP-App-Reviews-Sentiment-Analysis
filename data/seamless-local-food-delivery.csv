False,"I’ve been using Seemless/GrubHub for years and never had a problem- until the other night.  In NYC this past Tuesday night it was raining. When the whether is bad you kinda expect a delay in food delivery, but this one took the case. No only did the delivery guy claim to have delivered my food, he refused to answer the phone for me And the restaurant he works for. After all the calling back and forth, it’s now 11 p.m. and I knew I wouldn’t be able to get such healthy food at such an hour. So I decided to re-order the food and went to the restaurant to pick it up and paid cash.
I told the restaurant to take the $$ for my order out of his pay to make sure He didn’t get away with it. At least I was reimbursed for the order I Never received.... who would think about doing such a thing?
Besides, it’s Not like he got into an accident, maybe skidding in the water because of the rain... (yes, that happened before), but at least I got my food from a restaurant I always order from, so I knew my delivery guy on that run... This was the 1st time I ordered from this deli, but I see I’ll have to pick up my food from now on from this one.
Otherwise, I love the convenience of ordering food <3.","{'id': 11476589, 'body': 'Hey Cachae7.

True,"Uhh, this app is great. I started using it cause I thought DoorDash was too expensive. However, while trying to order Taco Bell I noticed the $4 delivery fee, service fees costing more than taxes, and that big fat tip. I find it quite ridiculous that I’m paying $36 for something that will cost me $17 to go get myself. Why would I pay more in service fees than I’m paying my own country? There should be a service fee flat rate of like $1. I also don’t see why I’m paying a delivery fee that isn’t going to the driver. It’s not like Seamless is paying for my driver’s transportation. My drivers usually come on bikes or little mopeds. I know good and well y’all are not giving them that money. And if y’all aren’t doing the delivery yourself there’s no reason you should be paid for their work. Unless you are using that money specifically for them. That goes for seamless, Taco Bell, or whoever needs to hear it. Sometimes I don’t have it on me to tip. Sometimes I don’t have the money. And the drivers are furious w that. So maybe they should be paid more? Enough so they don’t feel they’re living off of tips. Also, the Taco Bell items on Seamless are more expensive than they are on DoorDash. That’s weird!","{'id': 11997368, 'body': "" Hello Asia Shakur, Thank you for your feedback! We are working to improve the app, fee's and services daily for our customers.

False,"I just wish seamless didn’t try to absolve themselves of any responsibility in the “help” section of the app, saying to please contact the restaurant for any issues. For future reference, once there is an issue, you better contact seamless within 24 hours to have any chance of being refunded.

It doesn’t make sense that the restaurant is going to be able to refund your credit card for non-delivered food, all the statements are linked to seamless. However I took the restaurant’s assurance that they would cancel the order on good faith. Heaven forbid you decide to wait to see if the credit card statement will clear because then you will be outside of the seamless “24 hour query” window that allows you to dispute the order.

From the press it’s clear that these services are not profitable for the restaurants. The proprietors are probably tired of having to deal with people calling them about late food and other order issues because of discrepancies in seamless’ estimated delivery times, or opening times.","{'id': 11808794, 'body': 'Hello altruisticpunisher, We really appreciate your feedback, Have an awesome day!', 'modified': '2019-11-12T23:12:17Z'}",2019-11-08 21:02:28,5,“Please contact the restaurant”,altruisticpunisher,seamless-local-food-delivery,381840917
False,"I've used Seamless many times before and it's been great, but had a terrible experience today. I decided to try out ordering at a restaurant that uses a driver. I closed my eyes for a few minutes because I had a pounding headache but left my ringer on, knowing I'd get a call once he was here. Eventually I happened to check my phone, and saw there was one notification for Seamless that said my driver had been there for a couple of minutes but would only be there for a few more because he had been contacting me and waiting. I never received ANY calls or texts, I checked my call history, and when I tried calling him via the app it said there was a ""connection problem"". It let me text him as I was running downstairs, but he never answered. It finally let me call him and he said he had already left and was ""too far away"" to come back, even though it had only been a few minutes. I tried calling Seamless customer service to get a refund, but after explaining the situation, they could only offer me a ""sorry"" and a discount on my next order because apparently in their history it said he called me. There is nothing in my call history, he never contacted me. How is this my fault? I'm very upset with Seamless and would appreciate if someone would refund my order, otherwise I will be very wary of using this company for my deliveries in the future, as I cannot trust it.

False,"Unreliable. If you want to wait 2-3 hours for cold food, this is the app for you. If you want to wait 2-3 hours to have your order cancelled at the last minute because there are no drivers on the road this is ur spot. You will starve to death messing with this app. Crazy part is Seamless won’t even tell u or message u to know or provide a map so ur aware of what’s really going with ur order. 90% of the time the restaurant has the food ready but they don’t have enough delivery workers. The other 10% of the time restaurants delivering ur food to the wrong place or not delivering it at all but having it written in as delivered. Seamless does things in the wrong order, they should do driver first, order second instead they do it the other way around and then ur food left at the restaurant and both u and them mad at seamless. DoorDash is my go to cause they have a map similar to the Uber map so you can see about how far your driver is, and they give you a small profile of ur dasher similar to the blurb on ur Uber driver. They match a driver first then let u order and if they don’t have drivers they tell u. Full transparency unlike seamless who will hide it from you. They also have very cheap delivery rates and deliver reliably.","{'id': 5980430, 'body': 'Hello Chipotbae.  I am sorry to hear that about your experience with Seamless.

False,"The usability on this app can be frustrating at times. Firstly I like the past orders section. However if I press on the name of restaurant it should bring me to the menu not to the last order I made. If I tap on the white card with the order details, then sure show me the last order I made. The expectation is that if I click on the name, I want to order something different from that restaurant. 
The other use case is viewing the status of my order. I have no idea how to do this. It was not appearing under My Seamless. If I tap on the gear icon I also don’t see anything related. Eventually I had to rely on my email to figure out the status. Loading into the app now I see that “Your Order has been picked up” but I never saw any intermediate status (order received, order in the works, etc). 
Additionally when I switched from delivery to pickup option, the tip section was impossible to toggle off without starting the whole process over. 
Lastly, the Restaurant tab times out so often it’s frustrating to click on. However as this could be due to a number of factors that are beyond developer control like poor connectivity, I mention it last. But it’s still important as many people I know order food on their commute home, so they aren’t on the best wifi.","{'id': 7284243, 'body': 'We appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

False,"Seamless used to be my favorite third party app for food delivery. I would say in the past 2 years they’ve started to imitate certain fees and features that UBEREATS and DoorDash are famous for and I’m not sure why they would do that when they were one of the best in the first place. Before all the changes, only restaurants that used their own drivers were on the app. It was great because the tip went directly to the drivers and if there was an issue you could call the restaurant directly. Then they started hiring drivers themselves in order to accommodate places that normally didnt offer deliveries, but this came with tons of fees and parameters. If you ordered from KFC for example, there’d be a delivery fee, plus a service fee, small order fee, PLUS tax and tip! However, ordering from these types of places was a choice and therefore Seamless was still #1. 

I don’t know why they decided to implement more changes but it’s absolutely shameful that y’all are charging service fees for ALL restaurants even if they DONT USE YOUR DRIVERS! How money hungry of you guys! I tried to place an order yesterday with and the service fee was $3.50! That’s ridiculous and so unnecessary.

False,"I used to be one of seamless’s bigger customers, ordering 5-7x a week.  I’m done with them, extremely frustrated by repeated failure.  Twice in a row, seamless showed a restaurant to be open (not an odd time, like in the afternoon, for Lunch) and listed a delivery wait Time.  I ordered and received a confirmation and a delivery time from seamless.  Then, nothing happened.  No delivery, called the restaurant and there was no answer.  Here’s the weird part - no refund was ever issued unless I called Seamless to register a complaint. Just not acceptable.  Customer service gave me the lame explanation that the restaurant closed for the prior night and just didn’t turn off seamless.   Just ridiculous.   So beware.  Track your order carefully.  Even call the restaurant.  Better yet, use another service that doesn’t suffer from this amateur problem.  I use caviar now.

False,"It was laughable how poorly they treated me when i brought up that they had never sent me my promo codes after multiple people used my link to order food, how do i know they actually ordered? Because it was at my home my own sisters ordered food for our get together we were excited to continue to uses seamless however I never got my end of the promotion when i reached out to see why. the fist two customer service agents left the chat midway & the third! wow was he the rudest ive possibly ever encountered he kept insisting Id need to first make a seamless purchase. I didn’t understand this since i have been using seamless since 2018 and showed him screenshots of my past orders and of my account email address which were ignored as he said “its your problem not ours” and continued to ignore me and my questions until he left the chat. I might actually reddit the transcripts because they are unbelievably rude! comically bad! 

Apparently this is a reoccurring issue (not receiving promo codes) because when I brought it up in discussion and on twitter many have had the same experience.

False,I don’t know if my last review went through but I need people to know this app has gone downhill. I’ve been using it for years and my last few orders have had delivery problems. I know it’s not with the restaurants because I call the restaurants and they say drivers either don’t come or they take the food. I ordered food earlier today and it never came. I called the restaurant and they told me the driver that came to get my food and another person is all of a sudden MIA. They told me to call seamless and told me they told the other guy to do the same. I call Seamless to get it resolved and they said the guy called me a couple of times (never got those calls btw) so they would only offer me 50% off my next order and not a refund. When I called the restaurant they said Seamless told the other guy the same thing. I essentially just paid $25 for Seamless to waste my time. This happened before and I ended up having to walk to the restaurant to get my food which kinda defeats the purpose of a delivery app. Screw this app. I’d rather pay the delivery fees from better apps and actually get my food than use Seamless again.

These changes clearly weren’t made with the user in mind, so I’m guessing they thought they’d please restaurant owners by forcing users to spend more time looking at their menus and not ruling a place out based on how high the fee is.

Two days ago I ordered the delivery, the driver drove with my order claiming she tried to contact me. I never received the order, never got a call, tried to contact a customer care agent, and they refused to give me a refund for my order that I never received. Instead gave coupons which I still had to spend money. I was robbed. Today I ordered and suddenly after an hour of waiting my order was cancelled without any explanation. So I tried ordering again, and the same happened where the delivery driver drove off with my food and reported it as delivered when I never received my food. I called a customer care agent and he gave me a refund and a coupon for this order. I spent over $50 today on seemless for nothing but a bunch of cancelled orders. It takes 10 days to get that money back in my bank account. People don’t have money to just waste. I’m 9 months pregnant and on bed rest. This company robs people of their money.

The problem with this is it’s a massive building where hundreds of people live in not the best neighborhood in Brooklyn where pedestrians walk by every 2 seconds. The other problem is another tenant in my building also ordered Chipotle at the same exact time and his delivery was brought in to the building and left at our front desk where we have 24 hour around the clock security guards. 
   When I called Seamless the woman I talked to couldn’t hardly speak English and she had to repeat everything she said multiple times which made things even worse.

Another time, it took 2 hours and 20 minutes for the food to be delivered when it said it would be 50 minutes. It was later than I had expected to eat, and got even later when I had to wait longer to heat up the cold food. 
Today, I ordered because it said the place stops receiving orders at 9:45PM. The order went through.  Then, I got an email stating that the place isn’t taking orders because they’re closed.

I am not one to write a scathing review, but after experiencing such poor service time and time again I could not stand for it much longer. Recently, my orders have habitually been extremely late (e.g. 1 hr from the estimated arrival) or cancelled after I’ve waited for a substantial amount of time. To make matters worse, the Seamless customer service does not offer any type of resolution to ameliorate the situation. More often than not, representatives tell me that there is not much they can do other than call the restaurant/driver or cancel the order and refund me. This doesn’t solve my problem of needing food to be delivered to me.

One system, however, is by far the most baffling one I’ve ever seen; When a restaurant doesn’t have its own staff for delivery, seamless will send it’s own drivers to pick it up and deliver it to you.

So I called customer support the next day and after being out on hold for 16 minutes I was hung up on with no follow up.

True,"I have no issues with the app itself or even the restaurants, but the drivers can be very frustrating at times. 90% of the time, they’re great. The other 10% though... completely unacceptable. It’s like the drivers don’t know or don’t care that you can see where they’re at and the status of your delivery. I watched a driver pick up my order, and then sit in the same place for 30 minutes. When I questioned him about it after he arrived, he said he was taking a break. WELL THEN WHY THE HELL DID YOU ACCEPT THE DELIVERY??? My food was cold and soggy from the condensation in the package. Other times, my food is picked up and taken 20 minutes in the wrong direction. If I’m going to pay $50 plus for food to be delivered, it should arrive as quickly as possible.

On top of that, it is almost impossible to search for anything specific anymore, because the results returned have nothing to do with the keywords, half the time. I can search “pad Thai” and have pizza joints and taquerias populate my results. In the past, the menu item searched for would also be highlighted in the results, no more.

What kind of business is that? You’ve already paid so there’s not a whole lot you can do about it. If you were at the restaurant you wouldn’t have to pay for the food you didn’t get, so why should you have to on delivered items??

Tipping in advance gives the drivers zero incentive to do a good job. I have clear delivery instructions but only half seem to be able to follow them. I’ve had to go track these drivers down because they are wandering the block or going to the wrong building.

So a delivery person who drove 2 blocks in their car deserve the same as a waiter or bartender who served you for hrs. Not to mention that because of the fees seem less takes the restaurants already charge between 4-18 dollar delivery fees that are all collected by the owner not any of the workers. 2) Seamless sends you 0 discounts if you use the app regularly even though the restaurants incur all the losses they’re the ones who must still themselves offer discounts if any because seamless reserves them for customers who do NOT use the app. I apparently have an old account which I was unaware of, they kept sending me discounts through it and when I would order the they would be invalid.

The few times I’ve had issues were resolved quickly by Seamless over the phone with a refund and credit/discounts for future orders. They were usually because the vendor at the store/restaurant made an error. I choose Seamless even when I have the menu and info to order directly to vendors because I don’t want to have to talk to people on a phone to get food.

Secondly, when food is ordered, addressed needs to be re-entered and I️t says food can of be ordered because it’s out of delivery area.  When inquired, seamless suggested that we use the web GUI.  Right, instead of fixing the problem or apologizing, try the website.  

There are plenty other food delivery services that can be used in NYC.

False,They have waaaay to many fees now. It’s weird to me that all these restaurants that are free delivery and also were free of fees are now adding $6 fees and that’s not including my tips I give the actual restaurant which I do feel comfortable giving... it’s not the restaurant’s fault for these fees it’s seamless. Not only are they charging fees from the customer but they charge fees from the restaurants that use their service as well. I noticed these fees went up during the pandemic which only tells me they wanted more profit off the massive amount of orders going in right now since people aren’t leaving their house. It’s scummy and very big company. These fees are not going to the drivers or the restaurants. It makes me uncomfortable giving $6 to seamless every order and not the drivers doing the hard work.

For some reason, Seamless thought this made searching for food too easy.  Now if you search ""Pecan Pie"" a hundred restaurants will appear that have nothing to do with pie.  It doesn't matter.  You can do this with any type of food, the results have nothing to do with what you type in.

You are supposed to tip based on your subtotal and not the taxes and delivery fees.  When you go to manually enter a custom tip, it gives you the “percentage” tip that it is...and it is always something very low when in reality I am leaving a 20% tip.  For seamless to suggest a 7 some dollar tip on a 20 dollar meal is absolutely ludicrous. Please change your tip suggestion percentages to be based on the subtotal of the order only.

False,"I would order from seamless at least 3-4x a week. It was my first time trying out “Perks” and likely my last time ever using Seamless. 

Imagine receiving a notification from seamless that there is a concern about your order “Driver couldn’t reach you.” This is laughable because the driver never tried calling you to tell you he arrived or left. 

You remember Seamless providing the ability in the past to request refunds/indicate an issue with your order or chat via text with a rep. Not anymore. 

You call seamless/grubhub, stay on the line for 30 minutes watching your lunch hour tick away, only to first be told your driver is there (false). Then, after holding for much longer, you’re told the driver is on his next delivery already. But you’ve run out of time to eat (much less wait longer for the driver to come back), and so now you just want to cancel your order. The rep insists he cannot refund your order but will give you 50% off your next one. Good job taking my money and running. 

Now when you check your order status it is somehow “Delivered.” Ouch.

If it is “Perk” to never get your food and still have to pay for it, that’s pretty twisted. Anywhere else, that’s called a scam.","{'id': 10685297, 'body': 'Thank you for using Seamless.

It can get very expensive if customers are expected to tip delivery fees and tax on top of their meals and/or merchandise.

PROs
I love the quick ordering, express reorder, the fact that I can handle gratuity in the app - all works well. Support has been excellent the few times I needed it. Choice of restaurants is pretty decent.  Ability to search for a specific food item, filter by a number of different metadata elements, all add to convenience.

CONS
Choice of restaurant is decent but incomplete in my neighborhood - some number of places aren’t in seamless yet. I also live on a neighborhood boundary which confuses the app; it will let me order from places that won’t deliver to me, and refuses to take orders from places that do, which means I have to call them.   Final con: the delivery estimates are absolute garbage. I’ve almost never had one come close, and the app does not provide updates. A basic: “order has left restaurant” would be handy.","{'id': 3371963, 'body': ""Hello, Whydonickshavetobeunique?! We're happy to hear that you are enjoying our app!

False,Was such a big fan of the app for a while and used it since it was pretty intuitive and had a lot of restaurants I liked.

That’s not including if there is a delivery fee on top of it. The fees get placed in the subtotal so that ups the taxes and the tip and I’m not gunna short change the restaurant on a tip because of these extra fees. But I also won’t order at all if I’m paying40-70% more on my orders.

When you reorder an item that isn’t on the menu exactly how it was when previously ordered(ie the vendor has updated the item even if that item is still available) you get an incorrect error message at checkout saying that restaurant doesn’t deliver to your address(not true) or your payment details need to be updated(also not the case). 

Everything works after clearing your cart and making the selection through the restaurant page. 

The reorder process bugging out when the item has changed makes some sense but the incorrect error message is AWFUL. You end up wasting so much time trying to fix payment details or stop ordering from your favorite restaurants because you think they no longer deliver to your address.

Mind you the app still shows order is being processed and I have not be reimbursed

Every time I ask who is supposed to refund the money- I’m told grubhub. No refund yet and after telling the person on the text who claims “I’m a messenger” - now he says grubhub and seamless are the same. 

So 1 hour later: no food, no refund. Can’t even place an order from another place because a) it’s closing time and b) I don’t trust this app to have the right information.

False,"After having seen my friends and my husband have some terrible experiences with DoorDash and UberEats over the past few months, I just wanted to leave a review here because every time I was thinking “this would never happen with Seamless”. 

Despite whatever minor complaints people leave on here (most of the ones I just read sound like a user issue, not a system issue imo), I believe Seamless is still the best app out there for food delivery, and one with the best customer service. 

I’ve been using it for over 6 years now, in 2 different cities, for delivery to 9 different addresses. The only 2 times I remember having an issue where the restaurant did not deliver or canceled my order, Seamless customer service reached out to me proactively over the phone and email before I even had a chance to reach out to them, and handled the issue in the most appropriate and considerate way imaginable. Which I’ll admit I was probably taking for granted until the above-mentioned bad experiences with other providers.

Bottom line is that I always feel like I can call and talk to a live person at Seamless if I ever have an issue (although I never really do or need to) who will want to help me, AND I can actually call the restaurant directly, and they will treat me as their customer. With the other apps, it’s become apparent that their customer service is nearly impossible to reach and then just read from a script like a robot not listening to what you’re actually saying, and if you try to call the restaurant, they refuse to deal with you because they consider the delivery person to be their customer because that’s who pays them directly. 

The app itself is great and so easy to use, and its features and functionality have been improving over the years. But one thing I would suggest for future updates would be the ability to rate and/or review individual menu items and/or post pictures with reviews because sometimes I feel like I need to go to Yelp to figure out what to order. Or just buy Yelp lol.","{'id': 8097109, 'body': 'Hello Alyssa2727272727,Thank you for sharing your feedback.

False,"For the basic ordering of food, it’s fine. Too many steps to read reviews, and some big chains don’t display reviews, so why a particular franchise location has such a low rating is hard to discern. I err on the side of caution and do t order from them. 

The worst part of the app is the experience of signing-up for Seamless plus. I tried twice and it took four phone calls to get it right. 

I singed up as prompted during a check out with a restaurant. The itemised membership for $9.99 was right there. But a day later, the app still prompted me at every turn to sign-up. I could see no sign in account settings it was active. And no free deliveries for Seamless + participating businesses. 

First call I was told it would take 48 hours. Second call I was told I had signed up for Grub Hub plus and not Seamless+. Really? Inside the Seamless app. Insisted I had done so. So I tried again. Had to call back to get a refund for GrubHub+, and to see my status as a member. Still, some restaurants were charging for delivery while being listed CLEARLY as free delivery and being a Seamless+ participant.

By the way, the delivered order still showed it to be out for delivery and would for five days. 

Third call I was told, I kid you not, some restaurants participating in Seamless+ don’t offer free delivery. So I had a perk for free delivery for just such a place, which was $5 off AND free delivery. I apply the perk and the line-item order at checkout listed a delivery fee (no free indicator), a service fee (said to be waived because of Seamless+), and no indication of the $5 off where it is usually listed. Instead there was a line item marked separately and NOT adding up to the delivery fee, service fee, and $5 off. 

Fourth call and the rep claimed that was the Seamless+ freebies and the $5 off. Also claimed my refund for the never-wanted GrubHub membership had been applied when it had not. I had to demand it there on the phone. This refund had been promised to be next day and it had been a week. 

In summary: either there are hidden rules you can never be aware of, or this app shares data with the GrubHub app and confuses them. The order summary sometimes doesn’t show the discount(s) in a manner that accounts for perks, etc clearly. You might be signed up for another service entirely without being able to see this. And customer service can’t do much more than apologize.",,2020-10-07 20:12:21,5,Confusing and I Create Apps for a Living,Gabbertoons,seamless-local-food-delivery,381840917

True,"The problem below was resolved by customer service.  When I finally got to their representative, they listened to my problem and apologized for the inadequacy of their initial response.  They patiently  took input on my suggested change. They also gave me a courtesy discount on my next order.  I am back to being a satisfied customer.

Below is my initial complaint.

Seamless instructions for redeeming gift cards are unclear and customer service provided no help in resolving my problem. 

I received a $75 gift card for seamless.  When I read this instructions on how to redeem it, they said that you could add the card to your account OR wait until the time of your next order enter it. For convenience, I chose the first method.  When I did my next order, I assumed the “on account” amount would be available and debited against the order total.  I don’t recall seeing a message to pay from the gift card ( I use Seamless often and am familiar with the interface. After I received my order I checked my credit card online and saw that the $75 amount was not applied to my $77 order.  My credit card was charged the full amount.  

The worst part was the response of customer service.  They only have a chat service.  When I told the agent about the problem, he/she responded that agents could not make adjustments to the payment method after the order. When I asked if their was someone else with more authority who could,he just repeated the original response. I repeated that I thought the instructions were confusing and asked if someone else might help. The agent just stopped responding.  I waited for a while, thinking the agent might be consulting someone, but the agent just disappeared.  Seamless does not have a customer service phone# that I could find.

I should add that I would not have spent this much on one order had I not received this gift.  I am disappointed in Seamless customer service.  Some years back, when I had a problem, it was handled much more expeditiously, and by a phone agent who did not just disappear.","{'id': 21273683, 'body': ""Hello DougD027, Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your experience.

False,"I changed my phone number in 2018 and updated it immediately in the app. Back then I was using it constantly. Everything was fine up until a few months ago. Now when I order delivery they call the old number that I deleted 2 years ago. I changed the delivery instructions to call me and I manually put in the correct number just in case but the delivery people don’t bother to look at the instructions. Here’s the thing though. Why did the delivery guy have the wrong number but the restaurant was able to call me to tell me he was outside? How does that work? I ended up not getting my order the other night because of this and seamless denied my refund even though it was their mistake. After an exhausting search to be able to contact seamless (why did you guys suddenly decide to hide any way to contact you?) I got in touch with somebody who kept telling me to update my information in the app. Yeah buddy I did that 2 years ago thanks. That chat was going nowhere so I had to google the now secret phone number to call seamless and the person I spoke to, Carlos, basically told me the same thing and that they couldn’t refund the order but could send me promo codes to use in the future...and then never sent them. Carlos told me to email them. I asked for the email contact and he said he would text it to me. Guess who never got that text. I. Am. Done. With. You.

False,"The new algorithm and search capacity are so inefficient and frustrating. While I assume the change is revenue driven and helps restaurants have higher visibility on the app. As a user, I no longer want to use delivery services. When I searched for: Chicken Chili Verde on the app, not ONE Mexican restaurant appeared in the search. The restaurants that DID show up were Seamless + and none of them had anything on the menu that even resembled Chicken Chili Verde… they all had Chicken though. Then I decided to search for: Thai Basil Udon. Again, the same restaurants appeared at the top of my search. Nine were Thai. None were Mexican. None even had Udon. Apparently Sticky Fingers in NYC is a good customer of Seamless, because no matter what item I searched, Sticky Fingers and a few ghost restaurants that operate out of bodegas consistently appeared in my search.

I live in NYC and have used Seamless, DoorDash, Grubhub, Caviar and Postmates for years. I know my local restaurants and the specific menu items I order. I switched between all of these apps today trying to find my favorite restaurant and the exact menu item I was craving and have ordered before. I was unsuccessful, frustrated and finally gave up. I googled the restaurant and ordered directly on their website instead of Seamless.

I loved discovering new restaurants and the ability to find and order my favorite food in seconds while using Seamless. I was a huge fan, until this week. The user experience is clunky, poorly executed and inefficient. I deleted the app. I’m not paying a fee to Seamless to waste my time and leave me frustrated and hungry.","{'id': 25907931, 'body': 'Hi Smithnyla, Thanks for this feedback.

False,"WHAT is UP with these crazy high price increases for services charges and taxes that FAR exceed the taxes charged when buying this food directly from restaurants?!?

I get that you need to make money but were you not making plenty prior to this?? I get that you have to pay staff but this price gouging is only ensuring their tips are reduced. Your customers cannot afford to keep up with your pricing & most Are likely using your app far LESS now. I know I am. And like many, I’m using other apps more since you’ve officially exceeded their costs AND your deliveries are still far from the degree of professionalism they OUGHT TO BE, ESPECIALLY at these prices. 

Regularly missing items, condiments and cutlery always missing, even large items in separate bags missing, like shakes or sodas. It honestly costs the same or even less to use far more advanced services like Post Mates. And you never have the constant deals that Uber Eats offers. 

Yes, you/Grub Hub is usually there to take calls and make good on missing items, COLD, super late or disgusting food (when restaurant’s fault—EXCEPT when closed & you make us wait) BUT like I said, at these prices, there should NOT be major or constant issues. Furthermore, missing items typically means one or more person has their meal ruined and just paying back that particular item does little to remedy that. Even IF a missing items is picked up by the driver and brought to us, it still isn’t very helpful bc by then, meals are over and/or fresh/hot food is now soggy and cold, etc.

False,"1. No default address setting 
2. Closed restaurants display as if open
3. Restaurants shown to user are based off user shopping habits rather than proximity
4. Extremely limited filtering options

————-

1. Where are most of the people accessing this app? At home. But occasionally, users will order food to OTHER locations: friends homes, family’s homes, an Airbnb, hotel, etc. Users will always remember to update address to a non-home location when ordering. Why doesn’t my address reset back to my default location so that I don’t accidentally order food to a place that isn’t my home? 

2. You can turn on the app and see hundreds of restaurants if you live in a major city. What you don’t know is that most of them are closed but there’s no way to tell. Grubhub needs to hold restaurants accountable for accurate store hours and update their UI to show closed restaurants as soon as they close. Why can I not filter based on hours of operation for a restaurant? 

3. A lot of people order the same things over time but everyone gets bored of the same meal nonstop. Everyone will want to explore new options. Why are the hundreds of restaurants hidden by ones that I’ve recently ordered from? Show me restaurants based on proximity in that order with go-to place in a separate list and highlighted in the main display so they stand out.

4. The fact that I can’t filter by cuisine without typing it in is horrible. What if I’m looking for Italian OR Asian? I can’t do that in one search? What if I want those two types but ordered by proximity AND price? 

Fire your product managers working on this app. These are BASIC functionality and with the surge in online orders, Grubhub has the cash to invest in product improvement so do it.

False,"Expect to pay more for delivery compared to every food delivery app out there, for the same exact service. 

*Please refer to my first review experience review below for more information. The restaurants name is irrelevant as I expect many other restaurants ""provide their own drivers"" as well*

Two reasons why this was my first seamless order and last. 

First, I didn't eat dinner last night (thanks to this restaurant). I decided to try a new service that claimed to provide a easy stress-free ""no-human"" service. I guess I did get a ""no-human"" service because my food never came. After first calling the restaurant asking about my orders status, I was told I would have to wait only 10 minutes longer passed my estimated delivery time, no problem. Only this was a horrible lie as I waited another 30 before I called customer service for an updated ETA for just 20 minutes longer, ""fine I can wait"" I thought, until a total two hours after my initial order (which was placed when I was already feeling hungry as many of your customers probably do). Finally I decided to cancel my order and go to sleep hungry because any buisness that lies to its customers especially *hungry paying customers* does not deserve my, or anyone else's, buisness. (Edit: This was 2 hours after my order was placed, and still no update after the initial ""the restaurant is now preparing your order"" status)

Second, Seamless charges a $9 delivery fee for this restaurant, I assumed that meant I would get a service that reflects that price *especially since the SAME delivery order can be made on yelp with a $2 delivery charge*. Unfortunately this premium delivery price comes with the exact same quality service as the $2 ,or even free, delivery option. When I initially asked Seamless customer service why my order had *no* status update 40 minutes after my order confirmation (which was my estimated delivery wait time) I was told that this restaurant provides their own driver...

This is more insulting than a seamless delivery driver being late because this means *there is no difference your service provides from any other* I might as well call the buisness myself, pay less of a delivery charge, and get the same horrible service this restaurant provides. 

If your restaurants provide their own drivers, you must hold them to the standards you'd for your own drivers. Read the reviews, this isn't uncommon with this restaurant.

False,"I have been a seamless user for years and recently been very disappointed to find out how much extra we are being charged for ordering through the app due to hidden fees and higher menu prices. Call me a slow learner I guess but I had no idea! 

More on the two things I’m unhappy with:
1 - I recently noticed seamless has hidden a $1.00 fee combined with the taxes, while claiming delivery is free. I don’t know how long this has been going on but it’s pretty sneaky. When you click on the “i” it then tells you it is charging a $1 fee to cover their administrative costs or something-well then don’t combine it with taxes, as you know most people won’t notice it there and don’t realize they’re paying extra to seamless!

2 - I was shocked to discover recently that the food prices on seamless are totally jacked up vs what the regular restaurant menu prices are. I’m talking $1 to $2 more per item for a cheap diner menu. So unbeknownst to me, I have been paying for the fees seamless charges the restaurants!!! I assume restaurants are forced to increase prices to offset the high percentage that seamless charges them, but this is very uncool! Heck I could just call and order directly for $5-10 less every time. Or order through a delivery service like uber eats and pay a couple dollars for the delivery and come out better than on seamless. 

I am experimenting now with other methods though of course seamless is hard to beat for the variety of restaurants and ease of ordering. At least now when I use it I’m aware I’m getting robbed on multiple fronts!","{'id': 21273595, 'body': ""Hello Febodubo, Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your experience.

False,"I’m done with Grubhub/ Seamless. I’ve been moving over to Postmates/ Caviar for the last year and the experience I just had with their customer service representative just made me move 100% in that direction. 

1) there was a service fee on the delivery, which arrived over an hour later than I was told; this did not get refunded. They offered me “store credit” of $5 (this was a fifty dollar order...) instead, which, uh, I’m not going to use. 
2) my food arrived literally ice cold - no offer of compensation on this. I tipped 20%. Again- outside of the $5 offer above, no offer of compensation. 20% of $50 is ten dollars. Which is what I paid for my food to arrive cold. 
3) my food arrived MISSING ITEMS. The restaurant I ordered from always has a side with their sandwiches, no side. And then there’s the side I paid for - the only offer I got for a refund here was on the price of the item, not including tax/ tip/ service fee. And no partial refund for the missing included side?
4) the customer service rep was super rude - they didn’t offer anything aside from the $5 credit and the refunded item, and then kept putting me on hold just for the restaurant themselves to call me with info on my refund. If Seamless doesn’t do any of this on my end, why use them as a vendor?! There are better options out there. 

All in all, given the poor service I received today, I really wouldn’t re-download the app. And it would take WAY more for me to consider going back to Seamless - y’all aren’t the only game anymore.

False,"Or use Eat24 (they have outstanding customer service).

This is a story about mediocre customer service. And remember: I’m just ordering take-out Chinese food. Seamless is attempting to take something that is already trivially easy and make it easier. But then this happens.

Placed our order at 10:01pm, 30-40 minute delivery. At 10:55pm I called the restaurant for an update. I was told only the manager handled online orders, and would have to call me back. Someone called back at 10:58pm to say my order was on its way. Tried calling again at 11:27pm, but no answer. Called Seamless at 11:28pm. Was told that they wouldn’t issue a refund until they spoke with the restaurant — which was now closed. Was also told that the food was delivered at 10:55pm, three minutes before the manager called me to tell me it was out for delivery. Seamless was not able to reach the restaurant, as expected. Despite the fact that I specifically asked Seamless to call me back with the update, they managed to go straight to voicemail. I tweeted Seamless with my frustration and complaint. They reconfirmed all of this, and said they would issue a refund immediately “as a one time courtesy”, and made it very clear that they don’t trust “claims” until they speak to the restaurant.

As of 1:00am — hours after the restaurant closed — the Seamless app still reported that my order was out for delivery.

Seamless took a frustrating delivery experience and turned it into an angering, insulting mess, holding me and my money hostage. They made it clear that issuing refunds promptly and without a complicated discussion across multiple channels is something they consider a “one time courtesy”. Having spent a lot of money over the years with Seamless, without issue, this is insulting. I should have just ordered from the restaurant over the phone and avoided all of this, except the missed delivery. At least then the only thing I would be missing would be my food.

False,"First, i love the app and use it often.  the neighborhood is dense with delivery options and its very convenient, easy and usually reliable.  EXCEPT for a frustrating glitch that allows you to place an order with a restaurant that will never deliver your food that day.  you order, the final page says 'confirmed', you wait an hour for food, and finally when something seems amiss you check your email to find out you've made a 'pre-order' for the next day because the restaurant is closed. that's crazy.  i shouldn't even have the restaurant as an option if it's closing.  nobody wants their burger and nachos the next day when the restaurant opens.  
Seamless has always responded well and reversed my charges, but frankly i would rather just have the food, because it is usually later in the day when this happens, and it takes two hours or more before u finally get something from someplace.  a notice when the restaurant is a half-hour from closing would be totally useful!!!  and prevent this from continuing.  multiple times.  at very minimum....dont make the final page i see on the app say 'confirmed' unless it actually is confirmed. it's now happened so frequently, i knew what was going on immediately.   not great.",,2017-04-21 03:10:43,5,1 serious flaw,Jim bob Bobby,seamless-local-food-delivery,381840917

When it comes to delivery times, there isn't much oversight. I wouldn't say this is entirely common, but I have had a few experiences where the food has been delivered nearly twice as long as the max time. I think seamless should do a better job at tracking this and making sure what it says is accurate and maintain some guidelines for repeated offenders. 

I made this sound worse than it actually is and I would say I do like the pickup feature much better. I like quickly ordering something in my neighborhood and running out to get it as well. It's nice to exactly order things how you want without confusion over the phone, and overall I think that's the best part about the app in both delivery or pickup.

This is something that only started happening after the iOS 10 update, and I hoping they'll fix it.  Second, the restaurants are not incentivized to keep their Seamless menus current, so you will often find yourself ordering something that is not available or does not exist. Third, a recent major upgrade severely limited your customization options,and I'm not sure whether that was Seamless or the restaurants or both, but it's annoying; now you have to put in the delivery instructions section what used to be menu options, and the restaurants don't always pay attention to that.  The one thing that remains awesome about seamless is that if you are having a problem with the restaurant and the delivery or the food, they act as the middleman, they take care of it, and they do not suffer fools gladly, so that is why I continue to use them as a middleman instead of ordering directly from a lot of these places.",,2016-10-27 00:50:12,3,"New app unnecessarily complicated, old app didn't need revamp",Theodora,seamless-local-food-delivery,381840917

If you're okay with paying a little bit more, you can skip a phone call, but I've noticed some of my potential orders being about $10 more. In these cases I just pick up the phone and call instead. Additionally I have found the estimated time of arrival associated with each restaurant to be completely inaccurate in every single order I have placed (I've placed around 15 orders).

I suspect that the accuracy of ratings, and the overall user experience is going to be heavily dependent on not just the quality of restaurants in one's area, but also the level of trusted communication between people in the neighbourhood. A larger impersonal neighbourhood, will likely allow bad vendors to take advantage of customers. But Seamless needs to take note and bar those persons from the app. They also should have something in their contract with vendors to repay persons for non delivery.

I have used seamless for years.  When I practiced law, I placed 1-2 orders a day and found the service reliable.  Recently, I’ve had a series of disappointing orders when vendors changed delivery estimates, failed to complete orders, or completed orders hours late.  I posted reviews about two particularly problematic vendors detailing my complaints and the reviews were never posted to their profiles.  I contacted seamless customer service after a few days and was informed that the review system got “backed up”  — which is simply ridiculous, unless seamless edits reviews or permits vendors to edit reviews.  It’s been over a week since submitting reviews and they still don’t appear online.  From this limited experience, it appears one cannot rely upon reviews to flag unreliable vendors.

While before, a delivery customer had no choice but to accept what was given to  them, no matter the quality of the food, nor the time it took to arrive, now there is an acceptable standard.

Not only did they charge me a dollar prior to me even ordering food, my delivery man also got lost, and was rude and loud to my neighbors. I ordered a pizza from one of my favorite fast-food pizzerias and the delivery men and women who come are usually very nice and are a joy to talk to.

Navigation with the app is pretty much straight forward. (Although) some items in stores dont have all the descriptive details that you would want but its still very easy.

The app lets you know when they are preparing as well as give you a notification of when they should ship the food to your house.

Cons:

Its good but they need to update the Address slot, every few days I notice I am putting in my address over again. It should be automatically in the system.

Also when they are delivering, they act like they cannot find my address and I am right on the corner in plain sight. They always end up down the block or a block they are not supposed to be on and I come looking for them.

Its a little expensive. So if I were you i wouldnt order all of the time. Your best bet is cooking otherwise you would go broke. 

Conclusion,
If you are really hungry, go and order from seamless they have takeouts from places that normally wont deliver, so this 3rd party would do the work. A little pricey but worth it.

Very easy to manage, prompt in telling you when restaurants are about to close, and my favourite feature (Does not Accept Cash) as GrubHub has incorporated as well. I can't tell you how many times I get my cart to checkout and realize a restaurant doesn't take cash, very irritating.

This is unacceptable and a total waste of my time. It's 10 minutes before I get the call and then I just have to cancel my order (and wait for the refund to get processed which can take days), then order something else and hope the restaurant actually has it.

The bigger flaw here is that I've had serious issues with checkout (errors when I try to place an order that prevent me from doing so), and even worse - the app refuses to let me even search for or navigate to some of my favorite, go-to restaurants.

It does look like they improved their rating logic, but that's not magic so 1 star for that. 1 star because I can order food once I figure out the problems and UI.

How do they make it better? User pictures of the meals they received? We want to see the actual dishes  people receive. Then we'll know what to expect. Better candid photos of the restaurant and dishes.

Tip should not be automatically included, most people want to tip the delivery person in person.

If you want to listen to your customers then add a function to allow it. Rather than have us use Apple review as our forum. 

We can help make your app better. That said well done, excellent app and service.

So, Seamless, explanation demanded: How does such a restaurant get 5 stars? (To be sure, I even typed in all 208 ratings into a spreadsheet now, and took the average: 1.995 stars out of 5).
